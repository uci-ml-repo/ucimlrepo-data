    "RelevantInfo": "The PD database consists of training and test files. The training data belongs to 20 PWP (6 female, 14 male) and 20 healthy individuals (10 female, 10 male) who appealed at the Department of Neurology in Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University. From all subjects, multiple types of sound recordings (26 voice samples including sustained vowels, numbers, words and short sentences) are taken.  A group of 26 linear and time\u00e2\u20ac\u201cfrequency based features are extracted from each voice sample. UPDRS ((Unified Parkinson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Disease Rating Scale) score of each patient which is determined by expert physician is also available in this dataset. Therefore, this dataset can also be used for regression.\r\n\r\nAfter collecting the training dataset which consists of multiple types of sound recordings and performing our experiments, in line with the obtained findings we continued collecting an independent test set from PWP via the same physician\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s examination process under the same conditions. During the collection of this dataset, 28 PD patients are asked to say only the sustained vowels 'a' and 'o' three times respectively which makes a total of 168 recordings. The same 26 features are extracted from voice samples of this dataset. This dataset can be used as an independent test set to validate the results obtained on training set.\r\n\r\nFurther details are contained in the following reference -- if you use this dataset, please cite: \r\nErdogdu Sakar, B., Isenkul, M., Sakar, C.O., Sertbas, A., Gurgen, F., Delil, S., Apaydin, H., Kursun,\r\nO., 'Collection and Analysis of a Parkinson Speech Dataset with Multiple Types of Sound\r\nRecordings', IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, vol. 17(4), pp. 828-834, 2013\r\n\r\nTraining Data File:\r\nEach subject has 26 voice samples including sustained vowels, numbers, words and short \r\nsentences.
