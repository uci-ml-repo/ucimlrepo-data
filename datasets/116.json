    "RelevantInfo": "The data was collected as part of the 1990 census. \r\n\r\nThere are 68 categorical attributes. This data set was derived from the USCensus1990raw data set. The attributes are listed in the file USCensus1990.attributes.txt (repeated below) and the coding for the values is described below. Many of the less useful attributes in the original data set have been dropped, the few continuous variables have been discretized and the few discrete variables that have a large number of possible values have been collapsed to have fewer possible values. \r\n\r\nMore specifically the USCensus1990 data set was obtained from the USCensus1990raw data set by the following sequence of operations; \r\n\r\n- Randomization: The order of the cases in the original USCensus1990raw data set were randomly permuted. \r\n- Selection of attributes: The 68 attributes included in the data set are given below. In the USCensus1990 data set we have added a single letter prefix to the original name. We add the letter 'i' to indicate that the original attribute values are used and 'd' to indicate that original attribute values for each case have been mapped to new values (the precise mapping is described below). \r\n\r\nHierarchies of values are provided in the file USCensus1990raw.coding.htm and the mapping functions used to transform the USCensus1990raw to the USCensus1990 data sets are giving in the file USCensus1990.mapping.sql. \r\n\r\nThe data is contained in a file called USCensus1990.data.txt. The first row contains the list of attributes. The first attribute is a caseid and should be ignored during analysis. The data is comma delimited with one case per row. ",

The mappings for the variables dAncstry1, dAncstry2, dHispanic, dIndustry, dOccup, dPOB were designed to correspond to a natural coarsening of the original values based on the information in the file coding.htm. The remaining variables are continuous valued variables and the mapping for these variables was chosen to make variables that were fairly uniformly distributed across the states (quantiles). The precise mappings are specified in the file USCensus1990.mapping.sql. This file contains all of T-SQL procedures used to map the variables. These procedures can be used directly in SQLServer to map the original values or translated to some other language. \r\n      --------------------------------------------------------------\r\n        Variable        Procedure\r\n      --------------------------------------------------------------\r\n        dAge            discAge\r\n        dAncstry1       discAncstry1\r\n        dAncstry2       discAncstry2\r\n        dHispanic       discHispanic\r\n        dHour89         discHour89\r\n        dHours          discHours\r\n        dIncome1        discIncome1\r\n        dIncome2        discIncome2to8\r\n        dIncome3        discIncome2to8\r\n        dIncome4        discIncome2to8\r\n        dIncome5        discIncome2to8\r\n        dIncome6        discIncome2to8\r\n        dIncome7        discIncome2to8\r\n        dIncome8        discIncome2to8\r\n        dIndustry       discIndustry\r\n        dOccup          discOccup\r\n        dPOB            discPOB\r\n        dPoverty        discPoverty\r\n        dPwgt1          discPwgt1\r\n        dRearning       discRearning\r\n        dRpincome       discRpincome\r\n        dTravtime       discTravtime\r\n        dWeek89         discWeek89\r\n        dYrsserv        discYrsserv\r\n\r\n",
