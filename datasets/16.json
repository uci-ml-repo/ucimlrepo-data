    "RelevantInfo": "Each record represents follow-up data for one breast cancer case.  These are consecutive patients seen by Dr. Wolberg since 1984, and include only those cases exhibiting invasive breast cancer and no evidence of distant metastases at the time of diagnosis. \r\n\r\nThe first 30 features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.  They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. A few of the images can be found at http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~street/images/\r\n\r\nThe separation described above was obtained using Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett, \"Decision Tree Construction Via Linear Programming.\" Proceedings of the 4th Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society, pp. 97-101, 1992], a classification method which uses linear programming to construct a decision tree.  Relevant features were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4 features and 1-3 separating planes.\r\n\r\nThe actual linear program used to obtain the separating plane in the 3-dimensional space is that described in: \r\n[K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: \"Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets\", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].\r\n\r\nThe Recurrence Surface Approximation (RSA) method is a linear programming model which predicts Time To Recur using both recurrent and nonrecurrent cases.  See references (i) and (ii) above for details of the RSA method. \r\n\r\nThis database is also available through the UW CS ftp server:\r\n\r\nftp ftp.cs.wisc.edu\r\ncd math-prog/cpo-dataset/machine-learn/WPBC/",
