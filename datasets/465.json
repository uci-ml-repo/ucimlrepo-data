    "RelevantInfo": "WESAD is a publicly available dataset for wearable stress and affect detection. This multimodal dataset features physiological and motion data, recorded from both a wrist- and a chest-worn device, of 15 subjects during a lab study. The following sensor modalities are included: blood volume pulse, electrocardiogram, electrodermal activity, electromyogram, respiration, body temperature, and three-axis acceleration. Moreover, the dataset bridges the gap between previous lab studies on stress and emotions, by containing three different affective states (neutral, stress, amusement). In addition, self-reports of the subjects, which were obtained using several established questionnaires, are contained in the dataset. Details can be found in the dataset's readme-file, as well as in [1].",

    "AttributeInfo": "Raw sensor data was recorded with two devices: a chest-worn device (RespiBAN) and a wrist-worn device (Empatica E4).\r\nThe RespiBAN device provides the following sensor data: electrocardiogram (ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA), electromyogram (EMG), respiration, body temperature, and three-axis acceleration. All signals are sampled at 700 Hz.\r\nThe Empatica E4 device provides the following sensor data: blood volume pulse (BVP, 64 Hz), electrodermal activity (EDA, 4 Hz), body temperature (4 Hz), and three-axis acceleration (32 Hz).\r\n\r\nThe dataset's readme-file contains all further details with respect to the dataset structure, data format (RespiBAN device, Empatica E4 device, synchronised data), study protocol, and the self-report questionnaires.",
