    "RelevantInfo": "The main goal of this data set is providing clean and valid signals for designing cuff-less blood pressure estimation algorithms. The raw electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmograph (PPG), and arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals are originally collected from the physionet.org and then some preprocessing and validation performed on them. (For more information about the process please refer to our paper)",
