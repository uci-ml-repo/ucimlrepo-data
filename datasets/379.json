The legitimate websites were collected from Yahoo and starting point directories using a web script developed in PHP. The PHP script was plugged with a browser and we collected 548 legitimate websites out of 1353 websites. There is 702 phishing URLs, and 103 suspicious URLs.  \r\n\r\nWhen a website is considered SUSPICIOUS that means it can be either phishy or legitimate, meaning the website held some legit and phishy features.
