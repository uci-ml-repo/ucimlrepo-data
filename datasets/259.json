    "RelevantInfo": "Uncompressing rcv1rcv2aminigoutte.tar.bz2 will create a directory  that contains 5 subdirectories EN, FR, GR, IT and SP, corresponding to the 5 languages. Each subdirectory in {EN, FR, GR, IT, SP} contains 5 files, each containing indexes of the documents written or translated in that language.  For example, EN contains files:\r\n - Index_EN-EN : Original English documents\r\n - Index_FR-EN : French documents translated to English\r\n - Index_GR-EN : German documents translated to English\r\n - Index_IT-EN : Italian documents translated to English\r\n - Index_SP-EN : Spanish documents translated to English\r\n\r\nAnd similarly for the 4 other languages.\r\n\r\nEach file contains one indexed document per line, in a format similar to SVM_light.  Each line is of the form: <cat> <feature>:<value> <feature>:<value> ... where <cat> is the category label, ie one of C15, CCAT, E21, ECAT, GCAT or M11. <feature>:<value> is the feature, value pair, in ascending order of feature index.\r\n\r\nThe order of documents is maintained in corresponding files, for example, FR/Index_EN-FR and EN/Index_EN-EN have the same number of documents (and therefore the same number of lines), in the same order. \r\n",

    "AttributeInfo": "We focused on six relatively populous categories: C15, CCAT, E21, ECAT, GCAT, M11. For each language and each class, we sampled up to 5000 documents from the RCV1 (for English) or RCV2 (for other languages). Documents belonging to more than one of our 6 classes were assigned the label of their smallest class.  This resulted in 12-30K documents per language, and 11-34K documents per class. The distribution of documents over languages and classes are:\r\n\r\n              Number of                   Vocabulary\r\nLanguage      documents     percentage       size\r\n************  **********   ************  ************ \r\nEnglish        18,758         16.78        21,531\r\nFrench         26,648         23.45        24,893\r\nGerman         29,953         26.80        34,279\r\nItalian        24,039         21.51        15,506\r\nSpanish        12,342         11.46        11,547\r\n-------\r\nTotal         111,740\r\n\r\nThe distribution of classes in the whole collection is\r\n           Number of                 \r\nClass      documents     percentage  \r\n*********  **********   ************ \r\nC15          18,816         16.84     \r\nCCAT         21,426         19.17     \r\nE21          13,701         12.26        \r\nECAT         19,198         17.18        \r\nGCAT         19,178         17.16        \r\nM11          19,421         17.39\r\n\r\n\r\nIn experiments that we conducted in cite{AUG09}, we considered each document available in a given language as the observed view for an example and all translated documents were used as the other views for that example, generated using Machine Translation.
