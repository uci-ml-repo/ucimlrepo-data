    "RelevantInfo": "Prediction of residuary resistance of sailing yachts at the initial design stage is of a great value for evaluating the ship\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance and for estimating the required propulsive power. Essential inputs include the basic hull dimensions and the boat velocity. \r\n\r\nThe Delft data set comprises 308 full-scale experiments, which were performed at the Delft Ship Hydromechanics Laboratory for that purpose. \r\nThese experiments include 22 different hull forms, derived from a parent form closely related to the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcStandfast 43\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 designed by Frans Maas.\r\n",
