    "RelevantInfo": "\r\nThe Daphnet Freezing of Gait Dataset is a dataset devised to benchmark automatic methods to recognize gait freeze from wearable acceleration sensors placed on legs and hip.\r\n\r\nThe dataset was recorded in the lab with emphasis on generating many freeze events. Users performed there kinds of tasks: straight line walking, walking with numerous turns, and finally a more realistic activity of daily living (ADL) task, where users went into different rooms while fetching coffee, opening doors, etc.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is the result of a collaboration between the Laboratory for Gait and Neurodynamics, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Israel and the Wearable Computing Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland. Recordings were run at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center in 2008. The study was approved by the local Human Subjects Review Committee, and was performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.\r\n",

It explain the data acquisition protocol, the kind of sensor used and their placement, and the nature of the data acquired. It also provides baseline results for the automated detection of freezing of gait, against which newer methods can be benchmarked. In particular it describes detection sensitivity/specificity for 3 sensor placements and 4 kinds of derived sensor signals, it analyzes detection latency, and provides first insight into user specific v.s. user independent performance.\r\n\r\nWe also appreciate if you inform us (daniel.roggen@ieee.org) of any publication using this dataset for cross-referencing purposes.\r\n",
