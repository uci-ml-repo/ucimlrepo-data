    "RelevantInfo": "The data was retrieved from a set of 53500 CT images from 74 different\r\npatients (43 male, 31 female).\r\n\r\nEach CT slice is described by two histograms in polar space.\r\nThe first histogram describes the location of bone structures in the image,\r\nthe second the location of air inclusions inside of the body.\r\nBoth histograms are concatenated to form the final feature vector.\r\nBins that are outside of the image are marked with the value -0.25.\r\n\r\nThe class variable (relative location of an image on the axial axis) was\r\nconstructed by manually annotating up to 10 different distinct landmarks in\r\neach CT Volume with known location. The location of slices in between\r\nlandmarks was interpolated.",
