    "RelevantInfo": "This is a data set containing 1080 documents of free text business descriptions of Brazilian companies categorized into a\r\nsubset of 9 categories cataloged in a table called National Classification of Economic Activities (Classifica\u00c3\u00a7\u00c3\u00a3o Nacional de\r\nAtividade Econ\u00c3\u00b4micas - CNAE). The original texts were pre-processed to obtain the current data set: initially, it was kept only\r\nletters and then it was removed prepositions of the texts. Next, the words were transformed to their canonical form. Finally,\r\neach document was represented as a vector, where the weight of each word is its frequency in the document. This data set is\r\nhighly sparse (99.22% of the matrix is filled with zeros).",
