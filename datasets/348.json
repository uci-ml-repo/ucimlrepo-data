    "RelevantInfo": "This dataset represents a real-life benchmark in the area of Ambient Assisted Living applications, as described in [1].\r\nThe binary classification task consists in predicting  the pattern of user movements in real-world office environments from time-series generated by a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). \r\nInput data contains temporal streams of radio signal strength (RSS) measured between the nodes of a WSN, comprising 5 sensors: 4 anchors deployed in the environment and 1 mote worn by the user. Data has been collected during user movements at the frequency of 8 Hz (8 samples per second). In the provided dataset, the RSS signals have been rescaled to the interval [-1,1], singly on the set of traces collected from each anchor (as in [1]).\r\nTarget data consists in a class label indicating whether the user's trajectory will lead to a change in the spatial context (i.e. a room change) or not. In particular, the target class +1 is associated to the location changing movements, while the target class -1 is associated to the location preserving movements.\r\nThe measurement campaign involved a number of 3 different environmental settings, each of which comprises 2 rooms (containing typical office furniture) separated by a corridor. A sketch of the common setup considered is provided in the attached Figure. In each environmental setting, the anchors are deployed in fixed positions near the rooms corners (at the height of 1.5 m from the ground), while the mobile is worn on the chest of the user. The Figure also shows a simplified illustration of the types of user trajectories considered, with straight paths yielding to a spatial context change and curved ones leading to spatial context preservation. Each path produces a trace of RSS measurements from the beginning of the trajectory until a marker point, which is denoted as M in the Figure. The marker M is the same for all the movements, therefore different paths cannot be distinguished based only on the RSS values collected at M.\r\n\r\nEach input file in the provided dataset contains data pertaining to one temporal sequence of input RSS data (1 user trajectory for each file). The dataset contains 314 sequences, for a total number of 13197 steps.\r\n\r\nFurther information can be found at the webpage: http://wnlab.isti.cnr.it/paolo/index.php/dataset/6rooms.\r\nA complete description of this dataset can be found in [1], which also provides details on the performance achieved by Echo State Networks on the corresponding classification task.\r\n",
