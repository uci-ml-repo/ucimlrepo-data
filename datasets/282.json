    "RelevantInfo": "The original paper demonstrated that it is possible to correctly replicate the experts' binary assessment with approximately 90% accuracy using both 10-fold cross-validation and leave-one-subject-out validation. We experimented with both random forests and support vector machines, using standard approaches for optimizing the SVM's hyperparameters. It will be interesting if researchers can improve on this finding using advanced machine learning tools.\r\n\r\nDetails for the dataset can be found on the following paper.\r\nA.

    "AttributeInfo": "Each attribute (feature) corresponds to the application of a speech signal processing algorithm which aims to characterise objectively the signal. These algorithms include standard perturbation analysis methods, wavelet-based features, fundamental frequency-based features, and tools used to mine nonlinear time-series. Because of the extensive number of attributes we refer the interested readers to the relevant papers for further details.",
