    "RelevantInfo": "This data was used by Hong and Young to illustrate the power of the optimal discriminant plane even in ill-posed settings. Applying the KNN method in the resulting plane gave 77% accuracy. However, these results are strongly biased (See Aeberhard's second ref. above, or email to stefan@coral.cs.jcu.edu.au). Results obtained by Aeberhard et al. are :\r\n \r\nRDA : 62.5%, KNN 53.1%, Opt. Disc. Plane 59.4%\r\n\r\nThe data described 3 types of pathological lung cancers. The Authors give no information on the individual variables nor on where the data was originally used.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-  In the original data 4 values for the fifth attribute were -1. These values have been changed to ? (unknown). (*)\r\n-  In the original data 1 value for the 39 attribute was 4.  This value has been changed to ? (unknown). (*)",
