    "RelevantInfo": "Indoor localization is a key topic for mobile computing. However, it is still very difficult for the mobile sensing community to compare state-of-art Indoor Positioning Systems due to the scarcity of publicly available databases. Magnetic field-based methods are becoming an important trend in this research field. Here, we present UJIIndoorLoc-Mag database, which can be used to compare magnetic field-based indoor localization methods. It consists of 270 continuous samples for training and 11 for testing. Each sample comprises a set of discrete captures taken along a corridor (or an intersection) with a period of 0.1 seconds. In total, there are almost 40.000 discrete captures, where each one contains features obtained from the magnetometer, the accelerometer and the orientation sensor of the device.\r\n\r\nData has been stored as a simple text file as follows: \r\n\r\nts_1\tmx_1\tmy_1\tmz_1\tax_1\tay_1\taz_1\tox_1\toy_1\toz_1\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nts_n\tmx_n\tmy_n\tmz_n\tax_n\tay_n\taz_n\tox_n\toy_n\toz_n\r\n<m>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nlat_1\tlon_1\tlat_2\tlon_2\tFS_1\tLS_1\t\t\t\t\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nlat_m\tlon_m\tlat_m+1\tlon_m+1\tFS_m\tLS_m\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nWhere n is the number of samples collected in the trajectory at a 0.1 seconds frequency and m is the number of segments (corridors) in the trajectory. Each sample contains the timestamp ts and the values from magnetometer, accelerometer and orientation sensors in the three axes, which are denoted with mx, my, mz, ax, ay, az, ox, oy and oz. Finally, lat_i and lon_i corresponds to the coordinates (latitude & longitude in decimal degrees) of the initial, intermediate (intersections) and final points. A trajectory with m corridors has m+1 points. FS_i and LS_i state for the i-th trajectory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first and last sample respectively in the full sequence of samples collected during the trajectory mapping. \r\n\r\nAccording to the previous structure, the text files are composed by two well-differentiated parts separated by the row indicating the number of segments in the trajectory: 1) the sequence of discrete samples taken during the trajectory mapping, and 2) the configuration data. \r\n\r\nThe first part contains the timestamp (the UNIX time format in milliseconds) and the vector data from magnetometer (Android\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD), accelerometer (TYPE_LINEAR_ACCELERATION) and orientation (TYPE_ORIENTATION) sensors. The accelerometer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s values do not include the gravity force to have a better representation of user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real movement. \r\n\r\nThe second part contains the information about location of initial, intermediate and ending points Moreover, the samples can be associated to corridor segments and, moreover, information about turnings is also provided in all the samples.\r\n\r\nThe database consists of 281 continuous samples, 270 are for training and 11 for testing. They have been stored as independent text files. The training ones are grouped into two main categories \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lines\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153curves\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. \r\n- The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lines\u00e2\u20ac\u009d group has 80 files and they stand for the single corridor case. The format for filename is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lXX_ZZ.txt\u00e2\u20ac\u009d where XX stands for the number of corridor & orientation (n or r) and ZZ stands for repetition. Example: l3r_03.txt\r\n- The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153curves\u00e2\u20ac\u009d group has 190 files and they stand for all possible trajectories considering two connected corridors only. The format for that group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s filename is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cXXYY_ZZ.txt\u00e2\u20ac\u009d where XX and YY stand for the number of corridor & orientation for the first and second corridors in the two corridors trajectory, and ZZ stands for repetition. Example: c5n1r_05.txt\r\n- The testing files\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 filename format is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ttPP.txt\u00e2\u20ac\u009d where PP stands for the complex testing trajectory number. Example: tt03.txt\r\n",
