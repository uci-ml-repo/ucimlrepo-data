    "RelevantInfo": "Brief Description of the Dataset:\r\n---------------------------------\r\nEach of the 19 activities is performed by eight subjects (4 female, 4 male, between the ages 20 and 30) for 5 minutes.\r\nTotal signal duration is 5 minutes for each activity of each subject.\r\nThe subjects are asked to perform the activities in their own style and were not restricted on how the activities should be performed. For this reason, there are inter-subject variations in the speeds and amplitudes of some activities. \r\nThe activities are performed at the Bilkent University Sports Hall, in the Electrical and Electronics Engineering Building, \r\nand in a flat outdoor area on campus. Sensor units are calibrated to acquire data at 25 Hz sampling frequency. The 5-min signals are divided into 5-sec segments so that 480(=60x8) signal segments are obtained for each activity.\r\n\r\nThe 19 activities are: \r\nsitting (A1), \r\nstanding (A2), \r\nlying on back and on right side (A3 and A4), \r\nascending and descending stairs (A5 and A6), \r\nstanding in an elevator still (A7) \r\nand moving around in an elevator (A8), \r\nwalking in a parking lot (A9), \r\nwalking on a treadmill with a speed of 4 km/h (in flat and 15 deg inclined positions) (A1\r\n0 and A11),\r\nrunning on a treadmill with a speed of 8 km/h (A12), \r\nexercising on a stepper (A13), \r\nexercising on a cross trainer (A14), \r\ncycling on an exercise bike in horizontal and vertical positions (A15 and A16),\r\nrowing (A17), \r\njumping (A18), \r\nand playing basketball (A19).\r\n\r\nFile structure:\r\n\r\n19 activities (a) (in the order given above)\r\n 8 subjects   (p)\r\n60 segments   (s)\r\n 5 units on torso (T), right arm (RA), left arm (LA), right leg (RL), left leg (LL)\r\n 9 sensors on each unit (x,y,z accelerometers, x,y,z gyroscopes, x,y,z magnetometers)\r\n \r\nFolders a01, a02, ..., a19 contain data recorded from the 19 activities.\r\n\r\nFor each activity, the subfolders p1, p2, ..., p8 contain data from each of the 8 subjects.\r\n\r\nIn each subfolder, there are 60 text files s01, s02, ..., s60, one for each segment.\r\n\r\nIn each text file, there are 5 units x 9 sensors = 45 columns and 5 sec x 25 Hz = 125 rows.\r\nEach column contains the 125 samples of data acquired from one of the sensors of one of the units over a period of 5 sec.\r\nEach row contains data acquired from all of the 45 sensor axes at a particular sampling instant separated by commas.\r\n\r\nColumns 1-45 correspond to:  \r\n T_xacc,  T_yacc,  T_zacc,  T_xgyro, ...,  T_ymag,  T_zmag,\r\nRA_xacc, RA_yacc, RA_zacc, RA_xgyro, ..., RA_ymag, RA_zmag,\r\nLA_xacc, LA_yacc, LA_zacc, LA_xgyro, ..., LA_ymag, LA_zmag,\r\nRL_xacc, RL_yacc, RL_zacc, RL_xgyro, ..., RL_ymag, RL_zmag,\r\nLL_xacc, LL_yacc, LL_zacc, LL_xgyro, ..., LL_ymag, LL_zmag.\r\n\r\nTherefore,\r\ncolumns  1-9  correspond to the sensors in unit 1 (T), \r\ncolumns 10-18 correspond to the sensors in unit 2 (RA), \r\ncolumns 19-27 correspond to the sensors in unit 3 (LA), \r\ncolumns 28-36 correspond to the sensors in unit 4 (RL), \r\ncolumns 37-45 correspond to the sensors in unit 5 (LL). \r\n",
