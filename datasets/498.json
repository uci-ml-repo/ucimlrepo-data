    "RelevantInfo": "This is an event log of an incident management process extracted from data gathered from the audit system of an instance of the ServiceNowTM platform used by an IT company. The event log is enriched with data loaded from a relational database underlying a corresponding process-aware information system. Information was anonymized for privacy.\r\n\r\nNumber of instances: 141,712 events (24,918 incidents)\r\nNumber of attributes: 36 attributes (1 case identifier, 1 state identifier, 32 descriptive attributes, 2 dependent variables)\r\n\r\nThe attributed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclosed_at\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is used to determine the dependent variable for the time completion prediction task. The attribute \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcresolved_at\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is highly correlated with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclosed_at\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. In this event log, some rows may have the same values (they are equal) since not all attributes involved in the real-world process are present in the log.\r\n\r\nAttributes used to record textual information are not placed in this log.\r\n\r\nThe missing values should be considered \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunknown information\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.",
