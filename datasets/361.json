    "RelevantInfo": "This dataset includes the recordings of five replicates of an 8-sensor array. Each unit holds 8 MOX sensors and integrates custom-designed electronics for sensor operating temperature control and signal acquisition.\r\n\r\nThe same experimental protocol was followed to measure the response of the 5 twin units. Each day, a different unit was tested, which included the presentation\r\nof 40 different gas conditions, presented in random order. In particular, the unit under test was exposed to 10 concentration levels of Ethanol, Methane, Ethylene, and Carbon Monoxide.\r\nThe duration of each experiment was 600 s, and the conductivity of each sensor was acquired at 100Hz.\r\n\r\nChannel, sensor type (from Figaro), and mean voltage in the heater are as follows: \r\n0: TGS2611 5.65 V\r\n1: TGS2612 5.65 V\r\n2: TGS2610 5.65 V\r\n3: TGS2602 5.65 V\r\n4: TGS2611 5.00 V\r\n5: TGS2612 5.00 V\r\n6: TGS2610 5.00 V\r\n7: TGS2602 5.00 V\r\n\r\nPresented concentration levels are as follows (in ppm):\r\nEthylene: 12.5, 25, 37.5, 50.0, 62.5, 75.0, 87.5, 100.0 , 112.5, 125.0\r\nEthanol: 12.5, 25.0, 37.5, 50.0, 62.5, 75.0, 87.5, 100.0 , 112.5, 125.0\r\nCarbon Monoxide: 25.0, 50.0, 75.0, 100.0 , 125.0 ,150.0, 175.0, 200.0, 225.0 , 250.0\r\nMethane: 25.0, 50.0, 75.0, 100.0 , 125.0 ,150.0, 175.0, 200.0, 225.0 , 250.0\r\n \r\nDays in which each detection platform was tested.\r\nUnit 1: 4,10,15,21\r\nUnit 2: 1,7,11,16\r\nUnit 3: 2,8,14,17\r\nUnit 4: 3,9\r\nUnit 5: 18,22\r\n\r\nMore information at:\r\nJ.
