    "RelevantInfo": "This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in the StatLib library.  In line with the use by Ross Quinlan (1993) in predicting the attribute \"mpg\", 8 of the original instances were removed because they had unknown values for the \"mpg\" attribute.  The original dataset is available in the file \"auto-mpg.data-original\".\r\n\r\n\"The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes.\" (Quinlan, 1993)",
