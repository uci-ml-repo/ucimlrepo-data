See waist_mounted_phone.PNG.\r\n      The data was collected from 30 participants within the age group of 22-79 years. \r\n      Each activity (standing, sitting, laying, walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs) was \r\n      performed for 60secs and the 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity  were \r\n      collected at a constant rate of 50Hz.",
