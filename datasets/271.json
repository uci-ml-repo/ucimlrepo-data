This dataset is composed by two instances of data, each one corresponding to a different \r\nuser and summing up to 35 days of fully labelled data. Each instance of the dataset is described by \r\nthree text files, namely: description, sensors events (features), activities of the daily living (labels). \r\nSensor events were recorded using a wireless sensor network and data were labelled manually.",
