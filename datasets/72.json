    "RelevantInfo": "This dataset consists of features of handwritten numerals (`0'--`9') extracted from a collection of Dutch utility maps. 200 patterns per class (for a total of 2,000 patterns) have been digitized in  binary images. These digits are represented in terms of the following six feature sets (files): \r\n\r\n1. mfeat-fou: 76 Fourier coefficients of the character shapes; \r\n2. mfeat-fac: 216 profile correlations; \r\n3. mfeat-kar: 64 Karhunen-Love coefficients; \r\n4. mfeat-pix: 240 pixel averages in 2 x 3 windows; \r\n5. mfeat-zer: 47 Zernike moments; \r\n6. mfeat-mor: 6 morphological features. \r\n\r\nIn each file the 2000 patterns are stored in ASCI on 2000 lines. The first 200 patterns are of class `0', followed by sets of 200 patterns for each of the classes `1' - `9'. Corresponding patterns in different feature sets (files) correspond to the same original character.\r\n\r\nThe source image dataset is lost. Using the pixel-dataset (mfeat-pix) sampled versions of the original images may be obtained (15 x 16 pixels).",
