Relevant Information\r\n    -- Data Set Characteristics: Multivariate, Sequential, Time-Series\r\n    -- This dataset represents ambient data collected in homes with volunteer residents.\r\n       Data are collected continuously while residents perform their normal routines.\r\n       Ambient PIR motion sensors, door/temperature sensors, and light switch sensors\r\n       are placed throughout the home of the volunteer.  The sensors are placed in locations\r\n       throughout the home that are related to specific activites of daily living that we\r\n       wish to capture.\r\n    -- The classification task is to predict the activity that is occurring in the smart\r\n       home and being observed by the ambient sensors.  The sensors communicate using the\r\n       ZigBee Pro protocol, forming a mesh network with all battery powered sensors as leaf\r\n       nodes and always-on devices (light switches and ZigBee relays) forming the branches\r\n       that connect back to the USB gateway on our local SHiB [2] server.\r\n    -- The original format captured from the sensors is provided, as well as the feature\r\n       vector we generate using a sliding window of 30 sensor events.  Each annotated data\r\n       file (ex: csh101/csh101.ann.txt) has a corresponding feature vector CSV file\r\n       (ex: csh101/csh101.ann.features.csv).  Most of the sensor data files contain labels\r\n       for two months of the collection period, though some contain labels for extended\r\n       time periods.\r\n    -- We have also included the entire dataset collected at each smart home in the original\r\n       format (ex: csh101/csh101.rawdata.txt) and the generated feature vector CSV file\r\n       (ex: csh101/csh101.rawdata.features.csv).\r\n    -- An analysis of the attributes for each features CSV file is found in the corresponding\r\n       readme (ex: csh101/csh101.ann.features.csv is described by\r\n       csh101/csh101.ann.features.README.txt).\r\n    -- The smart home layout, and sensor placement from the original formats is found\r\n       in the included sensor map for each smart home (ex: csh101/csh101.sensor_map.png).\r\n    -- The original format is:\r\n       <Date> <Time> <Sensor> <Translate01> <Translate02> <Message> <SensorType> <Activity>\r\n        -- <Date> is YYYY-MM-DD, in local time.\r\n        -- <Time> is HH:MM:SS.ms, 24-hour and in local time.\r\n        -- <Sensor> is the name of the sensor, this can be found on the sensor map.\r\n        -- <Translate01> is the room-level sensor location.\r\n        -- <Translate02> is more detailed, usually identifying what in the room the sensor\r\n           is aimed at or sensing.\r\n        -- <Message> is the message generated by the sensor (we define these in more detail\r\n           below).\r\n        -- <SensorType> is the type of sensor generating the event, so you know what to\r\n           expect for a message.  In these earlier smart homes many of the sensors could\r\n           be identified by their name, but in later configurations you had to use this\r\n           field to identify what sensor was sending the message.\r\n        -- Motion Sensor Package\r\n           Each motion sensor package contains a PIR motion detector and a resistive photocell\r\n           light sensor. The package also reports it's battery level and regularly checks\r\n           in with the sensor network (ZigBee Check-Ins).\r\n            -- Control4-Motion and Control4-MotionArea\r\n               Most motion sensors have a sticker in the lens that limits what it can see\r\n               to approximately a 3-foot diameter circle when mounted on the ceiling facing\r\n               down. Some motion sensors that do not have any sticker limiting their view\r\n               are called Control4-MotionArea and can detect motion within view, though\r\n               sensitivity to smaller body movements may be reduced beyond 20 feet.\r\n                -- Message Values\r\n                   Motion and MotionArea sensors always report ON or OFF.\r\n                -- Frequency\r\n                   The sensor will instantly send an ON message when detecting motion.\r\n                   1.25 seconds after it no longer observes motion the sensor will send OFF.\r\n            -- Control4-LightSensor\r\n                -- Message Values\r\n                   The light sensor will send integer values ranging from 0 to 100 (pitch\r\n                   black to very bright). The Motion sensors with stickers in the lens have\r\n                   a much more limited amount of light that hits the sensor, and may only\r\n                   observe a range from 0 to 10, with a rare spike to a much higher value\r\n                   when the lid is removed to replace a battery.\r\n                -- Frequency\r\n                   The current light level is bit-packed and sent with every message the\r\n                   package sends on ZigBee, but the light sensor itself can initiate a ZigBee\r\n                   message if the value changes by 15% from the last value it reported.\r\n            -- Control4-BatteryPercent\r\n                -- Message Values\r\n                   The battery percent is always an integer ranging from 0 to 100.\r\n                -- Frequency\r\n                   The battery levels are only allowed to report once every 6 hours, but\r\n                   only report when there is a change.  This means that some battery values\r\n                   may not be updated for days as the level has not changed.\r\n            -- Control4-Radio\r\n               These sensor messages were enabled when we upgraded our data collection systems\r\n               around 2014.\r\n                -- Message Values\r\n                   The ZigBee radio check-in always has the same message, OK.\r\n                -- Frequency\r\n                   The ZigBee radio checks in with the network about once every 30 minutes.\r\n                   A sudden lack of radio check-ins may indicate this sensor's battery has\r\n                   died or there is some interference disrupting communication on the ZigBee\r\n                   network.\r\n        -- Door Sensor Package\r\n            -- Control4-Door\r\n                -- Message Values\r\n                   The door sensor always report OPEN or CLOSE.\r\n                -- Frequency\r\n                   The sensor sends the message as soon as the magnetic reed switch changes.\r\n            -- Control4-Temperature\r\n               All door sensor packages have an internal temporature sensor, and the ability\r\n               to attach a second temperature probe.  This was used in some of the bathrooms\r\n               for measuring the temperature at the door and right next to the shower.\r\n                -- Message Values\r\n                   Messages are a decimal in Celsius with 0.5 degrees Celsius accuracy.\r\n                -- Frequency\r\n                   Messages are sent when the sensor detects a change in the measured\r\n                   temperature by 0.5 Celsius.\r\n            -- Control4-BatteryPercent\r\n                -- Message Values\r\n                   The battery percent is always an integer ranging from 0 to 100.\r\n                -- Frequency\r\n                   The battery levels are only allowed to report once every 6 hours, but\r\n                   only report when there is a change.

Some of\r\n                   the lights are dimmers, they report the change in value from 0 to 100 as\r\n                   they ramp up their brightness.  The switches simply report 0 or 100 when\r\n                   they turn off or on.\r\n                -- Frequency\r\n                   The light switches only report light messages when the value changes.\r\n            -- Control4-Button\r\n               With the data collection upgrade in 2014 we were able to start collecting\r\n               sensor events from residents interacting with the light switches.\r\n                -- Message Values\r\n                   The buttons have a variety of messages they send.  TAP is sent every time\r\n                   the button is pressed.  When the button is doing being tapped, the button\r\n                   will send TAP_COUNT_01 if the button was tapped once (we have observed\r\n                   tap counts as high as 12, but do not know the limit of the device).\r\n                   On the dimmer light switches there are also the DEPRESS and RELEASE messages\r\n                   that are sent then the button is held down to slowly dim the light up\r\n                   or down.\r\n                -- Frequency\r\n                   Messages are only sent with a participant interacts with the button.\r\n            -- Control4-Radio\r\n                -- Message Values\r\n                   The ZigBee radio check-in always has the same message, OK.\r\n                -- Frequency\r\n                   The ZigBee radio checks in with the network about once every 15 minutes.\r\n                   A sudden lack of radio check-ins may indicate this sensor's battery has\r\n                   died or there is some interference disrupting communication on the ZigBee\r\n                   network.",
