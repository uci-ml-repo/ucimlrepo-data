The aim here is to obtain an accuracy of 99 - 99.9%.\r\n\r\nThe examples in the original dataset were in time order, and this time order could presumably be relevant in classification.   However, this was not deemed relevant for StatLog purposes, so the order of the examples in the original dataset was randomised, and a portion of the original dataset removed for validation purposes.\r\n",
