    "RelevantInfo": "For recording patterns, we used a MYO Thalmic bracelet worn on a user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forearm, and a PC with a Bluetooth receiver. The bracelet is equipped with eight sensors equally spaced around the forearm that simultaneously acquire myographic signals. The signals are sent through a Bluetooth interface to a PC. \r\nWe present raw EMG data for 36 subjects while they performed series of static hand gestures.The subject performs two series, each of which consists of six (seven) basic gestures. Each gesture was performed for 3 seconds with a pause of 3 seconds between gestures.\r\n\r\nNumber of Instances is about 40000-50000 recordings in each column (30000 listed as guaranteed)",
