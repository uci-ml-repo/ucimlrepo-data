A sample abstract is shown in the next section.\r\n\r\nThe bag-of-word data was produced by automatically processing the abstracts with a text analyzer called NSFAbst, built using VisualText. While most fields of the output are very accurate, the authors were not extracted from the Investigator: field with 100% accuracy, due to wide variability in that field.\r\n\r\nThe word list came from a separate process, and may not include all the words of interest in the abstracts.
