Each USV set contains records of the format: {'USV-ID'; 'humidity-value'; 'temperature-value'; 'experiment-id';'sensing-time'}\r\nThe swarm of the USVs is moving according to a GPS pre-defined trajectory, whose relative way-points are specified in the README.pdf file. The USVs are floating over the sea surface in a coastal area of Athens (Greece). More information on the project: https://sites.google.com/view/gnfuv/outcome\r\n",
