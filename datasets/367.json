The dataset is reasonably sparse as only 10 of 113 possible heroes are chosen in a given game. All games were played in a space of 2 hours on the 13th of August, 2016\n\nThe data was collected using: https://gist.github.com/da-steve101/1a7ae319448db431715bd75391a66e1b",

    "AttributeInfo": "Each row of the dataset is a single game with the following features (in the order in the vector):\n1. Team won the game (1 or -1)\n2. Cluster ID (related to location)\n3. Game mode (eg All Pick)\n4. Game type (eg. Ranked)\n5 - end: Each element is an indicator for a hero. Value of 1 indicates that a player from team '1' played as that hero and '-1' for the other team. Hero can be selected by only one player each game. This means that each row has five '1' and five '-1' values.\n\nThe hero to id mapping can be found here: https://github.com/kronusme/dota2-api/blob/master/data/heroes.json",
