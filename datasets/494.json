    "RelevantInfo": "This data set consists of positions and absorbed power outputs of wave energy converters (WECs) in four real wave scenarios from the southern coast of Australia (Sydney, Adelaide, Perth and Tasmania). The applied converter model is a fully submerged three-tether converter called CETO [1]. 16 WECs locations are placed and optimized in a size-constrained environment. In terms of optimization, the problem is categorised as an expensive optimization problem that each farm evaluation takes several minutes. The results are derived from several popular and successful Evolutionary optimization methods that are published in [2,3].  The source code of the applied hydrodynamic simulator [4] is available by the below link: \r\nhttps://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/71840-wave-energy-converter-wec-array-simulator\r\n\r\nThis work was supported with supercomputing resources provided by the Phoenix HPC service at the University of Adelaide.\r\n",
