In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to\r\n this date.  The \"goal\" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient.  It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0).  \r\n   \r\nThe names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values.\r\n\r\nOne file has been \"processed\", that one containing the Cleveland database.  All four unprocessed files also exist in this directory.\r\n\r\nTo see Test Costs (donated by Peter Turney), please see the folder \"Costs\" ",
