It is on average 10 millions samples per track.\n* Nine audio features (consisting of 518 attributes) for each of the 106,574 tracks.\n* Given the metadata, multiple problems can be explored: recommendation, genre recognition, artist identification, year prediction, music annotation, unsupervized categorization.\n* The dataset is split into four sizes: small, medium, large, full.\n* Please see the paper and the GitHub repository for more information (https://github.com/mdeff/fma)",
