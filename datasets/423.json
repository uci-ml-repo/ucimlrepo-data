    "RelevantInfo": "HCC dataset was obtained at a University Hospital in Portugal and contais several demographic, risk factors, laboratory and overall survival features of 165 real patients diagnosed with HCC. The dataset contains 49 features selected according to the EASL-EORTC (European Association for the Study of the Liver - European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) Clinical Practice Guidelines, which are the current state-of-the-art on the management of HCC.\r\n\r\nThis is an heterogeneous dataset, with 23 quantitative variables, and 26 qualitative variables. Overall, missing data represents 10.22% of the whole dataset and only eight patients have complete information in all fields (4.85%). The target variables is the survival at 1 year, and was encoded as a binary variable: 0 (dies) and 1 (lives). A certain degree of class-imbalance is also present (63 cases labeled as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dies\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and 102 as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lives\u00e2\u20ac\u009d).\r\n\r\nA detailed description of the HCC dataset (feature's type/scale, range, mean/mode and missing data percentages) is provided in Santos et al.
