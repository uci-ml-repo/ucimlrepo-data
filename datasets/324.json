    "RelevantInfo": "The data consist of 16 binary inputs and one 'four-bit' one-hot classification output. The 16-bit inputs are binary-valued attack-point vectors. 1 indicates the substantial presence (0, absence) of an onset (note start) in a certain time window during one bar of 4/4 time music (not limited to percussion, hence *onset* vectors without duration) quantized to 16th-note subdivisions. Each vector has 16 positions in which there may be or not be an onset. The output classes (left to right: neutral, reverse clave, forward clave, and incoherent) were determined through the music-theoretic/ethnomusicological portion of the my dissertation studies, based on both double-blind listening tests and informal interviews with with four professional master-musicians, as well as decades of studying the music. Future uploads (subject only to formatting) can include an additional column of fuzzy descriptors (of the degree of match to the output class).",
