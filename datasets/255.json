Collecting information to form database is done by\r\nquestionnaire.

    "AttributeInfo": "We considered the following parameters as questions: age,\r\neducation, political attitudes, blog topic, and the type of the\r\nidentity in internet, the influence of managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 inefficiency on\r\ntendency, the effect of inefficient media on tendency, the\r\neffects of social and political conditions on tendency and\r\nfinally the effect of poverty in the province on tendency. The\r\nnoisy or too detailed data in database makes us far from to get\r\nproper and suitable answers of algorithms [8]. We preprocessed\r\nthe data and eliminated some non-relevant data.\r\nFinally the followings are considered as the main fields which\r\ninclude: education, political caprice, topics, local media\r\nturnover (LMT) and local, political and social space (LPSS).\r\nThe collected data are shown in Table 1.\r\nIn order to get correct answer, we classify bloggers to two\r\ngroups: professional bloggers and seasonal (temporary)\r\nbloggers. Professional bloggers are those who adopt blog as\r\nan effective digital media and interested in digital writing in\r\ncontinuous time intervals. Seasonal (temporary) bloggers\r\naren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t professional and follow blogging in discrete time\r\nperiods. In this study, we review the tendency factors\r\nconsidering whether these people are among professional\r\nbloggers (Pro Bloggers, PB) and then, consider the other\r\nfactors according to it.",
