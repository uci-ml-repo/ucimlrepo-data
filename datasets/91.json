I believe that \"irrelevant\" is used here as a synonym for \"not-applicable\", \"dna\", and \"does-not-apply\".  I believe that there is a mis-print in the figure he read in their PAMI-83 article.\r\n \r\nI have checked over each attribute value in this database.  It corresponds exactly with the copies listed in both Stepp's and Fisher's dissertations.",
