    "RelevantInfo": "The companion file is a Common Lisp demonstration file that generates knight-pin Chess end-game samples.  Start up Lisp and load the file. It generates 100 end-games and writes them to a separate file.  Look at the end of the file to see how to change it so that it will produce more end-games, or use the file for output that you wish.\r\n\r\nThe code is released for experimental, confidential use only. See the end of the file for load-time commands that generate a file of examples in Quinlan's format.\r\n\r\nNote: this program generates duplicates.  In one run, there were about 370 duplicates in the first 1000 instances (i.e., 630 distinct examples).",
