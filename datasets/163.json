More about the \r\nASR system can be found in [1]. Such a dataset will be really helpful to \r\nstudy the effect of speech recognition noise on text mining algorithms. \r\nThe first work which refered to this dataset was on noisy text classification[2].\r\n\r\nData Format:\r\n----------\r\nThere are 10 directories labeled by the topic name. \r\nEach contains 20 files of transcriptions.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n----------\r\n[1] L.
