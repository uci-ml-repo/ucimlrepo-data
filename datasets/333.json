    "RelevantInfo": "This data set contains training and testing data from a remote sensing study which mapped different forest types based on their spectral characteristics at visible-to-near infrared wavelengths, using ASTER satellite imagery. The output (forest type map) can be used to identify and/or quantify the ecosystem services (e.g. carbon storage, erosion protection) provided by the forest.",
