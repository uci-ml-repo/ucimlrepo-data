    "RelevantInfo": "The data set consists of images from 153 character fonts. Some fonts were scanned from a variety of devices: hand scanners, desktop scanners or cameras.  Other fonts were computer generated.  The .zip file contains .csv, comma delimited files, one for each font.  Each .csv file has a header row with the data set attribute names. \r\n\r\nThe Handprint images differ slightly from the standard MNIST dataset.  ",
