    "RelevantInfo": "Instrumentation:\r\nThe data were collected at a sampling rate of 500 Hz, using as a programming kernel the National Instrument\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (NI) Labview. The signals were band-pass filtered using a Butterworth Band Pass filter with low and high cutoff at 15Hz and 500Hz respectively and a notch filter at 50Hz to eliminate line interference artifacts.\r\nThe hardware that was used was an NI analog/digital conversion card NI USB- 009, mounted on a PC. The signal was taken from two Differential EMG Sensors and the signals were transmitted to a 2-channel EMG system by Delsys Bagnoli\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Handheld EMG Systems.\r\n\r\nProtocol: \r\nThe experiments consisted of freely and repeatedly grasping of different items, which were essential to conduct the hand movements. The speed and force were intentionally left to the subject\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s will. There were two forearm surface EMG electrodes Flexor Capri Ulnaris and Extensor Capri Radialis, Longus and Brevis) held in place by elastic bands and the reference electrode in the middle, in order to gather information about the muscle activation.\r\n\r\nThe subjects were asked to perform repeatedly the following six movements, which can be considered as daily hand grasps:\r\na) Spherical: for holding spherical tools\r\nb) Tip: for holding small tools \r\nc) Palmar: for grasping with palm facing the object\r\nd) Lateral: for holding thin, flat objects\r\ne) Cylindrical: for holding cylindrical tools\r\nf) Hook: for supporting a heavy load\r\n\r\nAn illustrative photo is included in the data folder.\r\n\r\nTwo different databases are included:\r\n1) 5 healthy subjects (two males and three females) of the same age approximately (20 to 22-year-old) conducted the six grasps for 30 times each. The measured time is 6 sec. There is a mat file available for every subject. \r\n2) 1 healthy subject (male, 22-year-old) conducted the six grasps for 100 times each for 3 consecutive days. The measured time is 5 sec. There is a mat file available for every day.",

    "RelevantPapers": "Since the data is signals in time domain, part of it can be used for classification using signal processing techniques and methods, such as Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). Moreover, suggested features for extraction can be Integrated Electromyogram (IEMG), Zero Crossing (ZC), Slope Sign Changes (SSC), Waveform Length (WL), Willison Amplitude (WAMP) etc. \r\n\r\nMore information can be found in the following paper:\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 C.

    "AttributeInfo": "Data Format:\r\nThe format of each mat file is the following: \r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The data per grasp and per channel are in separate table with an obvious naming. {Spherical --> (spher_ch1, spher_ch2), Tip --> (tip_ch1, tip_ch2), Palmar --> (palm_ch1, palm_ch2), Lateral --> (lat_ch1, lat_ch2), Cylindrical --> (cyl_ch1, cyl_ch2), Hook --> (hook_ch1, hook_ch2)}\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Each row of these tables has the whole signal per trial. The signal value is measured in Voltage.\r\n\r\nIn summary, in each subject, there will be a mat file with 12 matrixes, in which matrix there will be 30 (trials) rows and 3000 (points of the signal) columns for database 1 (or 100 rows and 2500 columns for database 2).\r\n",
