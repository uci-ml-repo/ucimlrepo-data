    "RelevantInfo": "The measurements were created to ease the development, comparison and evaluation of fingerprinting based hybrid indoor positioning methods. The measurements were recorded by the same kind of Android devices in order to reduce the effect of the variety of the hardware. The recording was preformed at weekend to reduce the noise of the environment. The measurements were performed in a three-story building and cover about 50% of it. ",
