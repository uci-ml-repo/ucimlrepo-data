    "RelevantInfo": "PPG-DaLiA is a publicly available dataset for PPG-based heart rate estimation. This multimodal dataset features physiological and motion data, recorded from both a wrist- and a chest-worn device, of 15 subjects while performing a wide range of activities under close to real-life conditions. The included ECG data provides heart rate ground truth. The included PPG- and 3D-accelerometer data can be used for heart rate estimation, while compensating for motion artefacts. Details can be found in the dataset's readme-file, as well as in [1].",

    "AttributeInfo": "Raw sensor data was recorded with two devices: a chest-worn device (RespiBAN) and a wrist-worn device (Empatica E4).\r\nThe RespiBAN device provides the following sensor data: electrocardiogram (ECG), respiration, and three-axis acceleration. All signals are sampled at 700 Hz.\r\nThe Empatica E4 device provides the following sensor data: blood volume pulse (BVP, 64 Hz), electrodermal activity (EDA, 4 Hz), body temperature (4 Hz), and three-axis acceleration (32 Hz).\r\n\r\nThe dataset's readme-file contains all further details with respect to the dataset structure, data format (RespiBAN device, Empatica E4 device, synchronised data), study protocol, ground truth generation, etc.",
