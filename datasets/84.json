For more information in any of them, read the README file in the directory corresponding to the domain.\r\n\r\n  * stripsworld: There are several directories related to this domain:\r\n\r\n       -- stripsworld: the domain for STRIPS.\r\n\r\n       -- extended-strips: an extension to the STRIPS domain where doors can be locked and there are keys for the locks.\r\n\r\n       -- multirobot: the STRIPS domain with two or more robots.\r\n\r\n\r\n  * blocksworld: There are several directories related to this domain:\r\n\r\n       -- blocksworld: the domain as was built initially.\r\n\r\n       -- frozenblocksworld: a stable version. Used for the manual.\r\n\r\n       -- extended-bw: an extension to blocksworld that deals with  the weight and location of the blocks.\r\n\r\n     (See also gridworld)\r\n\r\n  * eightpuzzle: a domain for solving the eight puzzle.\r\n\r\n  * grammar: a simple grammar.\r\n\r\n  * gridworld: a 3-D version of blocksworld.\r\n\r\n  * jupiter: Prodigy interacts with an external world, via the World Modelers.\r\n\r\n  * logic: a simple logic domain.\r\n\r\n  * matrix-algebra: gaussian elimination in matrices.\r\n\r\n  * r1: VAX configuration domain (a simplification of R1).\r\n\r\n  * rocket: chinese rocket domain.\r\n\r\n  * schedworld:  a machine shop scheduling domain.\r\n\r\n  * telescope: a domain for building telescope mirrors.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
