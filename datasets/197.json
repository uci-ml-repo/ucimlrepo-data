    "RelevantInfo": "The user first creates a classification model and then generates classified examples from it.\r\nTo create a model, the following are specified: the number of attributes (up to 1000) and their type (discrete or continuous), the number of classes (up to 10), the complexity of the underlying rules and the noise level. AutoUniv then produces a model through a process of constrained randomised search to satisfy the user's requirements. A model can have up to 3000 rules. Rare class models can be designed. A sequence of models can be designed to reflect concept and/or population drift. \r\n\r\nAutoUniv creates three text files for a model: a Prolog specification of the model used to generate examples (.aupl);  a user-friendly statement of the classification rules in an 'if ... then' format (.aurules);  a statistical summary of the main properties of the model, including its Bayes rate (.auprops).",
