    "RelevantInfo": "These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines. \r\n\r\nI think that the initial data set had around 30 variables, but for some reason I only have the 13 dimensional version. I had a list of what the 30 or so variables were, but a.)  I lost it, and b.), I would not know which 13 variables are included in the set.\r\n\r\nThe attributes are (dontated by Riccardo Leardi, riclea@anchem.unige.it )\r\n1) Alcohol\r\n2) Malic acid\r\n3) Ash\r\n4) Alcalinity of ash  \r\n5) Magnesium\r\n6) Total phenols\r\n7) Flavanoids\r\n8) Nonflavanoid phenols\r\n9) Proanthocyanins\r\n10)Color intensity\r\n11)Hue\r\n12)OD280/OD315 of diluted wines\r\n13)Proline \r\n\r\nIn a classification context, this is a well posed problem with \"well behaved\" class structures. A good data set for first testing of a new classifier, but not very challenging.           ",
