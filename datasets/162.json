    "RelevantInfo": "In [Cortez and Morais, 2007], the output 'area' was first transformed with a ln(x+1) function.\r\n   Then, several Data Mining methods were applied. After fitting the models, the outputs were\r\n   post-processed with the inverse of the ln(x+1) transform. Four different input setups were\r\n   used. The experiments were conducted using a 10-fold (cross-validation) x 30 runs. Two\r\n   regression metrics were measured: MAD and RMSE. A Gaussian support vector machine (SVM) fed\r\n   with only 4 direct weather conditions (temp, RH, wind and rain) obtained the best MAD value:\r\n   12.71 +- 0.01 (mean and confidence interval within 95% using a t-student distribution). The\r\n   best RMSE was attained by the naive mean predictor. An analysis to the regression error curve\r\n   (REC) shows that the SVM model predicts more examples within a lower admitted error. In effect,\r\n   the SVM model predicts better small fires, which are the majority. ",
