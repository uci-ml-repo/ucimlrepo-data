The data contains 41 demographic and employment related variables. \r\n\r\nThe instance weight indicates the number of people in the population that each record represents due to stratified sampling. To do real analysis and derive conclusions, this field must be used. This attribute should *not* be used in the classifiers. \r\n\r\nOne instance per line with comma delimited fields. There are 199523 instances in the data file and 99762 in the test file. \r\n\r\nThe data was split into train/test in approximately 2/3, 1/3 proportions using MineSet's MIndUtil mineset-to-mlc. \r\n",
