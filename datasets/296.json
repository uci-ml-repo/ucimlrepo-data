It includes over 50 features representing patient and hospital outcomes. Information was extracted from the database for encounters that satisfied the following criteria.\n(1)\tIt is an inpatient encounter (a hospital admission).\n(2)\tIt is a diabetic encounter, that is, one during which any kind of diabetes was entered to the system as a diagnosis.\n(3)\tThe length of stay was at least 1 day and at most 14 days.\n(4)\tLaboratory tests were performed during the encounter.\n(5)\tMedications were administered during the encounter.\nThe data contains such attributes as patient number, race, gender, age, admission type, time in hospital, medical specialty of admitting physician, number of lab test performed, HbA1c test result, diagnosis, number of medication, diabetic medications, number of outpatient, inpatient, and emergency visits in the year before the hospitalization, etc.",
