    "RelevantInfo": "Ross Quinlan:\r\n\r\nThis data was given to me by Karl Ulrich at MIT in 1986.  I didn't record his description at the time, but here's his subsequent (1992) recollection:\r\n \r\n\"I seem to remember that the data was from a simulation of a servo system involving a servo amplifier, a motor, a lead screw/nut, and a sliding carriage of some sort.  It may have been on of the translational axes of a robot on the 9th floor of the AI lab.  In any case, the output value is almost certainly a rise time, or the time required for the system to respond to a step change in a position set point.\"\r\n \r\n(Quinlan, ML'93)\r\n\r\n\"This is an interesting collection of data provided by Karl Ulrich.  It covers an extremely non-linear phenomenon - predicting the rise time of a servomechanism in terms of two (continuous) gain settings and two (discrete) choices of mechanical linkages.\"",
