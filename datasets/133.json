    "RelevantInfo": "The data comes from Internet Information Server (IIS) logs for msnbc.com and news-related portions of msn.com for the entire day of September, 28, 1999 (Pacific Standard Time). Each sequence in the dataset corresponds to page views of a user during that twenty-four hour period. Each event in the sequence corresponds to a user's request for a page. Requests are not recorded at the finest level of detail---that is, at the level of URL, but rather, they are recorded at the level of page category (as determined by a site administrator). The categories are \"frontpage\", \"news\", \"tech\", \"local\", \"opinion\", \"on-air\", \"misc\", \"weather\", \"health\", \"living\", \"business\", \"sports\", \"summary\", \"bbs\" (bulletin board service), \"travel\", \"msn-news\", and \"msn-sports\". Any page requests served via a caching mechanism were not recorded in the server logs and, hence, not present in the data.\r\n\r\nOther Relevant Information:\r\n\r\n    * Number of users: 989818\r\n    * Average number of vitis per user: 5.7\r\n    * Number of URLs per category: 10 to 5000\r\n",

Each row below \"% Sequences:\" describes the hits--in order--of a single user. For example, the first user hits \"frontpage\" twice, and the second user hits \"news\" once.",
