All attribute names and values have been changed to meaningless symbols to protect confidentiality of the data.\r\n  \r\nThis dataset is interesting because there is a good mix of attributes -- continuous, nominal with small numbers of values, and nominal with larger numbers of values.  There are also a few missing values.\r\n",
