    "RelevantInfo": "The donation includes 5 datasets, each of them defining a different learning problem:\r\n\r\n    * LP1: failures in approach to grasp position\r\n    * LP2: failures in transfer of a part\r\n    * LP3: position of part after a transfer failure\r\n    * LP4: failures in approach to ungrasp position\r\n    * LP5: failures in motion with part\r\n\r\nIn order to improve classification accuracy, a set of five feature transformation strategies (based on statistical summary features, discrete Fourier transform, etc.) was defined and evaluated. This enabled an average improvement of 20% in accuracy. The most accessible reference is [Seabra Lopes and Camarinha-Matos, 1998].",

    "AttributeInfo": "All features are numeric although they are integer valued only. Each feature represents a force or a torque measured after failure detection; each failure instance is characterized in terms of 15 force/torque samples collected at regular time intervals starting immediately after failure detection; The total observation window for each failure instance was of 315 ms.\r\n\r\nEach example is described as follows:\r\n\r\n                 class\r\n                 Fx1\tFy1\tFz1\tTx1\tTy1\tTz1\r\n                 Fx2\tFy2\tFz2\tTx2\tTy2\tTz2\r\n                 ......\r\n                 Fx15\tFy15\tFz15\tTx15\tTy15\tTz15\r\n\r\nwhere Fx1 ... Fx15 is the evolution of force Fx in the observation window, the same for Fy, Fz and the torques; there is a total of 90 features. ",
