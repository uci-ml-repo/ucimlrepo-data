    "RelevantInfo": "The dataset include 30 patients with early untreated Parkinson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disease (PD), 50 patients with REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD), which are at high risk developing Parkinson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disease or other synucleinopathies; and 50 healthy controls (HC). All patients were scored clinically by a well-trained professional neurologist with experience in movement disorders. All subjects were examined during a single session with a speech specialist. All subjects performed reading of standardized, phonetically-balanced text of 80 words and monologue about their interests, job, family or current activities for approximately 90\u00e2\u20ac\u2030seconds. Speech features were automatically analyzed by Hlavni\u00c4\u008dka et al. (2017). \r\n\r\nThe dataset is provided in xls and csv format. The table is organized as follows:\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tFirst two rows include header\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tFirst row denote sections (Demographic information, Clinical information, etc.)\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tSecond row denote attribute\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tEach row in range from 3 to 132 corresponds to one particular subject identified by a unique code (first column). The code indicate also clinical diagnosis of the subject (PD, RBD, or HC)\r\n\r\nFor further details about the computational procedures, please see Hlavni\u00c4\u008dka (2017), or contact rusz.mz (at) gmail.com.
