All students consented to this data\r\n#  being shared for research purposes provided no uniquely identifiable\r\n#  information was contained in the distributed files.  The information\r\n#  was collected through various means, with emphasis being placed on\r\n#  the collection of objective, quantifiable information.  For more\r\n#  information on the data collection procedures, please see the paper\r\n#  referenced above.\r\n#\r\n#\r\n#  PRIVACY\r\n#  -------\r\n#  The data contained in this file does not contain any information\r\n#  which may be individually traced to a particular student who\r\n#  participated in the study.\r\n#\r\n#\r\n#  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DATA SOURCES AND DERIVATIONS\r\n#  -------------------------------------------------\r\n#  SAMs (Student Activity Measure) are collected for each student team\r\n#  member during their participation in a software engineering class.\r\n#  Student teams work together on a final class project, and comprise\r\n#  5-6 students.  Teams that are made up of students from only one\r\n#  school are labeled local teams.  Teams made up of students from more\r\n#  than one school are labeled global teams.  SAMs are collected from:\r\n#  weekly timecards, instructor observations, and software engineering\r\n#  tool usage logs.  SAMs are then aggregated by team and time interval\r\n#  (see next section) into TAMs (Team Activity Measure).  Outcomes are\r\n#  determined at the end of the semester through evaluation of student\r\n#  team work in two categories:  software engineering process (how well\r\n#  the team applied best software engineering practices), and software\r\n#  engineering product (the quality of the finished product the team\r\n#  produced).  Thus for each team, two outcomes are determined, process\r\n#  and product, respectively.  Outcomes are classified into two class\r\n#  grades, A or F.  A represents teams that are at or above\r\n#  expectations, F represents teams that are below expectations or need\r\n#  attention.  For more information, please see the paper referenced\r\n#  above.\r\n#\r\n#  The SE process and SE product outcomes represent ML training classes\r\n#  and are to be considered separately, e.g. one should train ML for SE\r\n#  process separately from training for SE product.\r\n#\r\n#  TIME INTERVALS FOR WHICH DATA IS COLLECTED\r\n#  ------------------------------------------\r\n#  Data collected continuously throughout the semester are aggregated\r\n#  into different time intervals for the semester's project reflecting\r\n#  different dynamics of teamwork during the class.  Time intervals\r\n#  represent time periods in which a milestone was developed by each\r\n#  team.  A milestone represents a major deliverable point in the class\r\n#  for all student teams.  The milestones are roughly divided into the\r\n#  following topics:\r\n#\r\n#            M1 - high level requirements and specs\r\n#            M2 - more detailed requirements and specs\r\n#            M3 - first prototype\r\n#            M4 - beta release\r\n#            M5 - final delivery\r\n#\r\n#  Time intervals are combinations of the time in which milestones are\r\n#  being produced.  Time intervals are used in research only.\r\n#\r\n#  In addition to time intervals corresponding to milestones, a number\r\n#  of time intervals combining multiple T1-T5 time intervals have been\r\n#  calculated.  This was done to group student activities into design\r\n#  vs. implementation phases which have different dynamics.\r\n#\r\n#  These time intervals are defined as follows:\r\n#\r\n#      Time Interval        Corresponding Milestone Periods in Class\r\n#    -----------------    --------------------------------------------\r\n#           0               Milestone 0\r\n#           1               Milestone 1\r\n#           2               Milestone 2\r\n#           3               Milestone 3\r\n#           4               Milestone 4\r\n#           5               Milestone 5\r\n#           6               Milestone 1 - Milestone 2 inclusive\r\n#           7               Milestone 1 - Milestone 3 inclusive\r\n#           8               Milestone 1 - Milestone 4 inclusive\r\n#           9               Milestone 1 - Milestone 5 inclusive\r\n#          10               Milestone 4 - Milestone 5 inclusive\r\n#          11               Milestone 3 - Milestone 5 inclusive\r\n#\r\n#\r\n#\r\n#  SETAP PROJECT OVERALL DATA STATISTICS\r\n#  ================================================================== \r\n#  The following is a set of statistics about the entire dataset which\r\n#  may be useful in the configuration of machine learning methods.\r\n#\r\n#  This data was collected only from students at SFSU.

By using this systematic approach, TAM feature names are\r\n#  produced that are human understandable and intuitive and related to\r\n#  aggregation method.\r\n#\r\n#\r\n#  There are a number of base TAM which are then aggregated into\r\n#  aggregated TAM.\r\n#\r\n#  BASE TAM\r\n#  --------\r\n#\r\n#  General TAM\r\n#  -----------\r\n#  The following TAMs are collected for each team: Year, semester,\r\n#  timeInterval, teamNumber, semesterId, teamMemberCount,\r\n#  femaleTeamMembersPercent, teamLeadGender, teamDistribution\r\n#\r\n#  Calculated TAM\r\n#  --------------\r\n#  For each team, TAM were calculated from SAMs for every time interval\r\n#  Ti.  The core TAM variables where for each we compute as applicable:\r\n#  count, average, standard deviation over weeks, over students etc.\r\n#\r\n#  TAMs collected by Weekly Time Cards (WTS) TAM\r\n#  ---------------------------------------------\r\n#  teamMemberResponseCount, meetingHours, inPersonMeetingHours.\r\n#  nonCodingDeliverablesHours, codingDeliverablesHours, helpHours,\r\n#  globalLeadAdminHours, LeadAdminHoursResponseCount,\r\n#  GlobalLeadAdminHoursResponseCount\r\n#\r\n#  TAMs collected  by Tool Logs (TL) TAM\r\n#  -------------------------------------\r\n#  commitCount, uniqueCommitMessageCount, uniqueCommitMessagePercent,\r\n#  CommitMessageLength\r\n#\r\n#  Collected by Instructor Observations (IO) TAMs\r\n#  ------------------------------------------------\r\n#  issueCount, onTimeIssueCount, lateIssueCount\r\n#\r\n#\r\n#  AGGREGATED TAM\r\n#  --------------\r\n#\r\n#  Several aggregation method and derived variable names for TAMs\r\n#  reflect how the core TAM variables were aggregated in final TAM\r\n#  measures for each time interval Ti:\r\n#\r\n#  Let VAR be the core TAM variable above. The naming conventions and\r\n#  aggregation operators to obtain TAMs for each time interval Ti were\r\n#  as follows:\r\n#\r\n#  <VAR>Total - total sum of VAR in the time interval Ti\r\n#  <VAR>Average - average of VAR in the time interval\r\n#  <VAR>StandardDeviation - SD of variable in time interval\r\n#  <VAR>Count - count of events measured by VAR (e.g. missed\r\n#  checkpoints) in time interval\r\n#  Average<VAR>ByWeek - total sum/count of VAR in the time interval\r\n#  divided by weeks in time interval\r\n#  StandradDeviation<VAR>ByWeek - the standard devation of the weekly\r\n#  total of VAR taken over the time interval\r\n#  Average<VAR>ByStudent - total count/sum of VAR in time interval,\r\n#  divided by number of students in the team\r\n#  StandardDeviation <VAR>ByStudent - standard deviation of  VAR in the\r\n#  time interval, over students in the team\r\n#\r\n#\r\n#  NULL VALUES\r\n#  -----------\r\n#  NULL values are used in the training data to indicate that no SAMs\r\n#  were recorded in that particular time period, week, or for that\r\n#  student.\r\n#\r\n#  Frequently TAM features involving teamLeadHours or globalTeamLead\r\n#  hours will result in a NULL for a particular training sample.  For\r\n#  local team leads, that usually means that the local team lead did\r\n#  not complete any timecard surveys for the aggregation in quesiton.\r\n#  While for global team lead TAM features this may also be the case,\r\n#  the more usual cause of NULLS in global team lead TAM features comes\r\n#  from the fact that most teams are not global, and therefore this\r\n#  statistic was not gathered for these teams.\r\n#\r\n#  It is left to the individual researcher to decide how to accomodate\r\n#  NULL values, and the data is included in this file.  Though these\r\n#  may not be useful for machine learning directly, valuable\r\n#  information can be obatined with some processing.\r\n#\r\n#  TAM FEATURES\r\n#  ------------\r\n#  The following is a list of tam features available in the data files.\r\n#  The TAM feature names are listed in the order in which the data\r\n#  appear in each training sample, i.e. the first feature corresponds\r\n#  to the first column, the second feature corresponds to the second\r\n#  column, etc.\r\n#\r\n#  The first sample line in the data section of the data file is not a\r\n#  true sample, but consists of TAM feature names, which allows for\r\n#  easy import into spreadsheets and for human readability.\r\n#\r\n#  The final two TAM features (columns) are the outcome data for\r\n#  process and product, and are the last two columns in each sample\r\n#  row.
