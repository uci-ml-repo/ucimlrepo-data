    "RelevantInfo": "This DataSet is about the results of Statlog project. The project performed a comparative study between Statistical, Neural and Symbolic learning algorithms.\r\n\r\nProject StatLog (Esprit Project 5170) was concerned with comparative studies of different machine learning, neural and statistical classification algorithms. About 20 different algorithms were evaluated on more than 20 different datasets. The tests carried out under project produced many interesting results.\r\n\r\nThe results of these tests are comprehensively described in a book  (D.Michie et.al, 1994). ",
