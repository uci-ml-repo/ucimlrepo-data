They undergo three movements to analyze the behavior associated with the knee muscle , gait , leg extension from a sitting position , and flexion of the leg up. The acquisition process was conducted with 4 electrodes ( Vastus Medialis , semitendinosus , biceps femoris and rectus femoris ) and the goniometer in the knee .\r\n2.2.\tInstrumentation\r\nDatalog equipment was used MWX8 by Biometrics of 8 digital channels and 4 analog channels , of which 4 for sampling were used SEMG and 1 for goniometry, these data were acquired directly to the computer MWX8 internal storage with microSD card and transmitted in Real-time Datalog software through bluetooth adapter , 14-bit resolution and sampling frequency of 1000Hz .\r\n2.3.\tData configuration:\r\nThe total number of electrodes is 4, corresponding to the time series one for each channel (1 to 4). Each series contains ~ 5 shares or motion repetitions for each subject.",
