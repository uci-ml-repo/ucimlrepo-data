    "RelevantInfo": "The data-set comprises 2 x (4) sets of mobile sensor readings data (humidity, temperature) from four (4) Raspberry Pi's corresponding to a swarm of four (4) Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). Each USV set contains records of the format: {'Device'; 'humidity-value'; 'temperature-value'; 'experiment-id';'sensing-time','Pi'}. The swarm of the USVs is moving according to a GPS pre-defined trajectory. The USVs are floating over the sea surface in a coastal area of Athens (Greece).
