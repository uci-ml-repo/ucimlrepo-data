The control group consists of 64 healthy individuals (23 men and 41 women) with ages varying between 41 and 82 (61.1\u00c2\u00b18.9). During the data collection process, the microphone is set to 44.1 KHz and following the physician\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s examination, the sustained phonation of the vowel /a/ was collected from each subject with three repetitions.",
