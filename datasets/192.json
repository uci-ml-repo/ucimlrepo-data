These measurements plotted in the (real, -imaginary) plane constitute the impedance spectrum from where the breast tissue features are computed.\r\nThe dataset can be used for predicting the classification of either the original 6 classes or of 4 classes by merging together the fibro-adenoma, mastopathy and glandular classes whose discrimination is not important (they cannot be accurately discriminated anyway).",
