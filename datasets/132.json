    "RelevantInfo": "The data is stored in relational form across several files. The central file (MAIN) is a list of movies, each with a unique identifier. These identifiers may change in successive versions. The actors (CAST) for those movies are listed with their roles in a distinct file. More information about individual actors (ACTORS) is in a third file. All directors in MAIN are listed in a fourth file (PEOPLE), with a number of important producers, writers, and cinematographers. A fifth file (REMAKES) links movies that were copied to a substantial extent from each other. The sixth file (STUDIOS) provides some information about studios shown in MAIN.\r\n\r\nThe original motivation was for database class exercises, to replace the boring `manager of the toy-department' queries. Note that the CASTS, refering MAIN and ACTORS is logically identical to the inventory file refering to suppliers and assemblies in the the standard bill-of-materials problems. Personal interests caused the database to be made complete for all Hitchcock movies and TV episodes. Related films by type and actor were added gradually.\r\n\r\nSubsequent research on temporal databases caused date fields (years only) to be added. It allows testing, say, if the dates-of-work of an ACTOR match the dates of the MAIN films that the CAST relation shows. Object-oriented database features could be tested with fields having multiple and two-level values, as documented in DOC.\r\n\r\nThe entries were gradually collected during course work starting about 1975 and are still being updated. Most of the entries were manual. The DOC file lists some of the reference works used. Corrections and additions continue to be appreciated.\r\n\r\nDetailed descriptions of the fields and their formats is provided in doc.html. \r\n\r\nMissing Values:\r\n\r\nOutside of key fields, missing values are common. Their encoding is described in DOC. Sometimes the data seems to be unavailable, sometimes it hasn't been entered. Some information, as `lived-with' is inherently incomplete.\r\n\r\nCensored Data:\r\n\r\nMinor actors are ignored.\r\n\r\nDependencies:\r\n\r\nEvery MAIN film must have a director in PEOPLE. About 50 pseudo director names ahve been listed in PEOPLE to allow interesting films to with (yet) unknown directors to be entered. Every CASTS entry must relate to a MAIN film entry. Every ACTOR should appear in some CASTS entry, but not vice versa. See DOC for more type information.\r\n\r\nOther Relevant Information:\r\n\r\nFilms are listed, if known, with their original language title. An Alt(T: ) field provides English translations, where known.\r\n\r\nData Format:\r\n\r\nThe current files are in HTML, to allow easy parsing to other formats. An XML version is being considered.\r\n\r\nThe approximate file sizes are:\r\nDOC .......    50K \r\nMAIN ...... 1 145K   11 400 entries\r\nPEOPLE ....   355K    3 290 entries\r\nCASTS ..... 4 340K   46 000 entries\r\nACTORS ....   811K    6 800 entries\r\nREMAKES ...   135K    1 278 entries\r\nSTUDIOS ...    26K      200 entries\r\n",
