Furthermore, reviews are grouped into reports on the three aspects benefits, side effects and overall comment. Additionally, ratings are available concerning overall satisfaction as well as a 5 step side effect rating and a 5 step effectiveness rating. The data was obtained by crawling online pharmaceutical review sites. The intention was to study \r\n\r\n(1) sentiment analysis of drug experience over multiple facets, i.e. sentiments learned on specific aspects such as effectiveness and side effects,\r\n(2) the transferability of models among domains, i.e. conditions, and \r\n(3) the transferability of models among different data sources (see 'Drug Review Dataset (Drugs.com)').\r\n\r\nThe data is split into a train (75%) a test (25%) partition (see publication) and stored in two .tsv (tab-separated-values) files, respectively.\r\n\r\nImportant notes:\r\n\r\nWhen using this dataset, you agree that you\r\n1) only use the data for research purposes\r\n2) don't use the data for any commerical purposes\r\n3) don't distribute the data to anyone else\r\n4) cite us",
