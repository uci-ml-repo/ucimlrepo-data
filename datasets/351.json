    "RelevantInfo": "Malignant mesotheliomas (MM) are very aggressive tumors of the pleura. These tumors are connected to asbestos exposure,\r\nhowever it may also be related to previous simian virus 40 (SV40) infection and quite possible for genetic predisposition.\r\nMolecular mechanisms can also be implicated in the development of mesothelioma.\r\nRural living is associated with the development of mesothelioma. Soil mixtures containing asbestos, known as\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhite-soil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccorak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 can be found in Anatolia, Turkey and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLuto\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in Greece.\r\nMesothelioma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disease data set were prepared at Dicle University Faculty of Medicine in Turkey.\r\nThree hundred and twenty-four Mesothelioma patient data.
