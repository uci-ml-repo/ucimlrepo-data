    "RelevantInfo": "This dataset provides ground-truth class labels to evaluate performance of multi-instance learning models on both instance-level and bag-level label predictions. DeliciousMIL was first used in [1] to evaluate performance of MLTM, a multi-label multi-instance learning method, for document classification and sentence labeling.\r\n\r\nMulti-instance learning is a special class of weakly supervised machine learning methods where the learner receives a collection of labeled bags each containing multiple instances. A bag is set to have a particular class label if and only if at least one of its instances has that class label.\r\n\r\nDeliciousMIL consists of a subset of tagged web pages from the social bookmarking site delicious.com. The original web pages were obtained from DeliciousT140 dataset, which was collected by [2] from the delicious.com in June 2008. Users of the website delicious.com bookmarked each page with word tags. From this dataset, we extracted text parts of each web page and chose 20 common tags as class labels. These class labels are:\r\nreference, design, programming, internet, computer, web, java, writing, English, grammar, style, language, books, education, philosophy, politics, religion, science, history, and culture.\r\n\r\nWe randomly selected 12234 pages and randomly divided them into 8251 training and 3983 test documents. We also applied Porter stemming and standard stopword removal. \r\n\r\nEach text document is a bag within a multi-instance learning framework consisting of multiple sentences (instances). The goal is to predict document-level and sentence-level class labels on the test set using a model which is trained given only the document-level class labels in the training set.\r\nTo evaluate performance of such a model, we have manually labeled 1468 randomly selected sentences from the test documents. Please see [1] for more information. ",

    "AttributeInfo": "1) train-data.dat and test-data.dat:\r\nThese files contain the bag-of-word representation of the training and test documents. Each line is of the form:\r\n\r\n<S_d> sentence_1 sentence_2 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 sentence_{Sd}\r\n\r\nwhere Sd is the number of sentences in document d. Each sentence s is in the following format:\r\n\r\n<L_s> w_{1s} w_{2s} \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 w_{L_s s}\r\n\r\nwhere L_s is the number of words in sentence s, and w_{is} is an integer which indexes the i-th term in sentence s. \r\n\r\n2) vocabs.txt: This file contains the list of words used for indexing the document representations in data files. Each line contains: word, index.\r\n\r\n3) train-label.dat and test-label.dat:\r\nEach file contains a D by C binary matrix where D is the number of documents in every file and C=20 is the number of classes. The element b_{dc} is 1 if class c is present in document d and zero otherwise.\r\n\r\n4) test-sentlabel.dat, labeled_test_sentences.dat:\r\n\r\ntest-sentlabel.dat: This file contains class labels for sentences of the test documents.

For the rest of the sentences that are unlabeled, we set y_{scd}=-1. \r\n\r\nlabeled_test_sentences.dat: This file only contains the class labels for the 1468 sentences which are manually labeled. Each line of this file is of the form:\r\n\r\nd s y_{s1d} y_{s2d} \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 y_{sCd}\r\n\r\nwhere d and s are respectively document and sentence indices. \r\n\r\n4) labels.txt: This contains the list of all class labels in this dataset.
