Since the trains dataset records relations between attributes, this transformation was somewhat challenging.  However, it may shed some insight on this problem for people who are more familiar with the simple one-instance-per-line dataset format.\r\n\r\nHierarchy of values:\r\n     \r\nif (cshape is one of {openrect,opentrap,ushaped,dblopnrect}\r\nthen cshape is opentop\r\n    \r\nif (cshape is one of {hexagon,ellipse,closedrect,jaggedtop,slopetop, engine}\r\nthen cshape closedtop\r\n\r\nPrediction task: Determine concise decision rules distinguishing trains traveling east from those traveling west.",
