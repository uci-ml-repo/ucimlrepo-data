    "AttributeInfo": "Each data sample corresponds to one completed trip. It contains a total of 9 (nine) features, described as follows:\n\nTRIP_ID: (String) It contains a unique identifier for each trip;\n\nCALL_TYPE: (char) It identifies the way used to demand this service. It may contain one of three possible values:\n  - 'A' if this trip was dispatched from the central;\n  - 'B' if this trip was demanded directly to a taxi driver at a specific stand;\n  - 'C' otherwise (i.e. a trip demanded on a random street).\n\nORIGIN_CALL: (integer) It contains a unique identifier for each phone number which was used to demand, at least, one service. It identifies the trip's customer if CALL_TYPE='A'. Otherwise, it assumes a NULL value;\n\nORIGIN_STAND: (integer): It contains a unique identifier for the taxi stand. It identifies the starting point of the trip if CALL_TYPE='B'. Otherwise, it assumes a NULL value;\n\nTAXI_ID: (integer): It contains a unique identifier for the taxi driver that performed each trip;\n\nTIMESTAMP: (integer) Unix Timestamp (in seconds). It identifies the trip's start;\n\nDAYTYPE: (char) It identifies the daytype of the trip's start. It assumes one of three possible values:\n  - 'B' if this trip started on a holiday or any other special day (i.e. extending holidays, floating holidays, etc.);\n  - 'C' if the trip started on a day before a type-B day;\n  - 'A' otherwise (i.e. a normal day, workday or weekend).\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE: This field has not been correctly calculated. Please see the following links as reliable sources for official holidays in Portugal.\nhttp://calendar.retira.eu/public-holidays/portugal/2013/\nhttp://calendar.retira.eu/public-holidays/portugal/2014/\n\nMISSING_DATA: (Boolean) It is FALSE when the GPS data stream is complete and TRUE whenever one (or more) locations are missing;\n\nPOLYLINE: (String): It contains a list of GPS coordinates (i.e. WGS84 format) mapped as a string. The beginning and the end of the string are identified with brackets (i.e. [ and ], respectively). Each pair of coordinates is also identified by the same brackets as [LONGITUDE, LATITUDE]. This list contains one pair of coordinates for each 15 seconds of trip. The last list item corresponds to the trip's destination while the first one represents its start.",
