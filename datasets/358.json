    "RelevantInfo": "The PD and control handwriting database consists of 25 PWP (People with parkinson) and 15 healthy individuals who appealed at the Department of Neurology in Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University. From all subjects, three types of handwriting recordings (Static Spiral Test (SST), Dynamic Spiral Test (DST) and Stability Test on Certain Point (STCP)) are taken. Also the drawings of spirals belongs to the PWP are included in the dataset as image. Therefore, this dataset can also be used for regression.\r\n\r\nHandwriting  dataset  was  constructed  using  Wacom  Cintiq  12WX  graphics  (Hahne  et  al.,  2009) table. It  is  basically  a  graphics  tablet  and  LCD  monitor  rolled  into  one.  It  enables  to  display  a  PC's  screen  on  its  monitor  and  only  interacts  with  digitized  pens. Special software was designed for recording handwriting drawings and testing the coordination of the PD patients using the recordings. The software uses API functions of the device and was developed in C# platform which can be run on Windows systems You can contact with the authors to request the software which is mentioned [1].\r\n\r\nIn this study, there are three different kinds of tests developed for the data collection via graphics tablet. The first one isthe  Static  Spiral  Test  (SST)  which  is  frequently  used  for  clinical  research  in  the  literature  for  different  purposes  like  determining motor performance (Wang et al., 2008), measuring tremor (Pullman, 1998) and diagnosing PD (Saunders et al., 2008). In this test, three wound Archimedean spirals appears on the graphics tablet using the software and patients were asked to retrace the same spiral as much as they can using the digital pen. During the test, the features which are mentioned above and the other data to specify the patient are recorded to the database. \r\n\r\nThe second test is the Dynamic Spiral Test (DST). Unlike SST, Archimedean spiral just appears and disappears in certain time intervals, in other words the Archimedean spiral blinks. This forces the patient to keep the pattern in mind and continue to draw. The purpose of this test is to determine the change in patient's drawing performance and pause times since it is more difficult to retrace the Archimedean spiral in this case. As a result of this test, it is observed that most of the patients continued drawing but nearly all of them lost the pattern.\r\n\r\nThe third test is Stability Test on Certain Point (STCP). In this test, there is a certain red point in the middle of the screen and the subjects are asked to hold the digital pen on the point without touching the screen in a certain time. The purpose of this test is to determine the patient's hand stability or hand tremor level.\r\n\r\nFurther details are contained in the following reference -- if you use this dataset, please cite:\r\n\r\n1.Isenkul, M.E.; Sakar, B.E.; Kursun, O. .
