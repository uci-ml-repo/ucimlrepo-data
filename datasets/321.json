Some clients were created after 2011. In these cases consumption were considered zero.\r\nAll time labels report to Portuguese hour. However all days present 96 measures (24*4). Every year in March time change day (which has only 23 hours) the values between 1:00 am and 2:00 am are zero for all points. Every year in October time change day (which has 25 hours) the values between 1:00 am and 2:00 am aggregate the consumption of two hours.\r\n",
