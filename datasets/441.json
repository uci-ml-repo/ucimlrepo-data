Items are locations a user visits in this case.\r\ntw_ny (30k x 11k): Same as tw_oc but from the New York area.\r\n\r\ngo_sf (2k x 7k): Check-ins from the app Gowalla, from the San Fransisco area. Full dataset here: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-gowalla.html\r\ngo_ny (1k x 7k): Same as go_sf, but from the New York area.\r\n\r\nlastfm (992 x 15k): How many times, a user listened to each artist.
