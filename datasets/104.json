Some duplicates may exist and a single observation may have more than one value for a given attribute (esp. academic emphasis).\r\n\r\nIt appears that several attributes could serve as a distinguished class attribute for this database.  The data file remains in the state as given to us by Steve Souders.  It is a LISP readable file with a few relevant functions at the end of the data file.  The info on missing data values have not been calculated.  We hope to get to this in the future.",
