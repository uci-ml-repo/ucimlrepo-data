    "RelevantInfo": "Provide all relevant informatioThe data has been produced using Monte Carlo simulations. The first 8 features are kinematic properties measured by the particle detectors in the accelerator. The last ten features are functions of the first 8 features; these are high-level features derived by physicists to help discriminate between the two classes. There is an interest in using deep learning methods to obviate the need for physicists to manually develop such features. Benchmark results using Bayesian Decision Trees from a standard physics package and 5-layer neural networks and the dropout algorithm are presented in the original paper. The last 500,000 examples are used as a test set.n about your data set.",
