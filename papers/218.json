    "window": "so if we evaluate n nodes in the search, the total time is O(ntkA). In our experiments, t was limited to three, k was 10, and the number of nodes expanded was about 60. For example, on the <b>dna</b> dataset (which took the most time) C4.5 took just under 2 minutes, while C4.5-AP took 6.8 hours. 6 Related Work In statistics, model selection refers to the general problem of selecting a learning algorithm",
