    "window": "the estimated K 0 is close to K; e.g. for C5 type with M = 20, N = 10k, and K = 100, the estimated K 0 is 110. Results for high-dimensional benchmark datasets (e.g. Pendigit, <b>image segmentation</b>  and character) also show similar close estimates. The reason is with increasing dimensionality the difference between intra-cluster and inter-cluster distances",
