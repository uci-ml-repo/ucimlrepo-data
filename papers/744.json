For example, MLR only took 2.9 seconds as compare to 4790 seconds for the neural network in the <b>nettalk</b> dataset; while both have the same error rate. Other possible candidates are the multinomial logit model (Jordan & Jacobs, 1994), which is a special case of generalized linear models (McCullagh & Nelder,",
