We estimated the accuracy of the learned classifiers using 5-fold cross-validation, except for the \"shuttle-small\" and  <b>waveform</b> 21\" datasets where we used the hold-out method. We report the mean of the prediction accuracies over all cross-validation folds. We also report the standard deviation of the accuracies found in each fold. These",
