EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS In order to assess the benefits offered by the incremental framework, we conducted two experiments using the <b>Pima</b> <b>Indians</b> dataset from the UCI machine learning repository [1]. Using an RBF kernel K(x, y) = exp # - kx - yk 2 # 2 # , we first fixed the kernel width and varied (increased or decreased) the regularization parameter",
