    "year": "1997",
    "window": "Assistant-R and LFC achieve significantly better result (99.95% confidence level). This result confirms that RELIEFF estimates the quality of attributes better than the information gain. On the <b>VOTE data</b> set the naive Bayesian classifier is the worst, while both versions of Assistant are comparable to the rule based classifier by Smyth et al. [31]. The most interesting results appear in the MESH",
