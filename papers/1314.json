Figure 1 gives the value of the gini index along each of the nine numeric attributes of the <b>Shuttle</b> dataset. We show that the above properties can be used to develop an I/O and computationally e\u00c6cient method for estimating the split at every internal node. Experimental results on real and synthetic",
