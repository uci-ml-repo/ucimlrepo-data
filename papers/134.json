Figure 3 shows the evolution of the elimination process with the conflict-based weighting method for four of the data sets. In the case of <b>Letter Recognition</b>  for example, the algorithm starts with 234 discriminants and takes almost 3500 seconds to find a final set with 59. However, after 1000 sec. only 69",
