Figure 2 shows that FF allowed the naive Bayes to significantly do better predictions than F for the greatest part of the <b>Chess</b> data set. The maximum di i erence in prediction accuracy is obtained at instance 422, where the accuracies are 0.889 and 0.832 for the cases FF and F, respectively. Figure 2 does not report the BF case,",
