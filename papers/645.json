In another study, Setiono [26] used his rule extraction from ANNs algorithm [28, 29] to extract useful rules that can predict <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> from the <b>Wisconsin</b> dataset. He needed first to train an ANN using BP and achieved an accuracy level on the test data of approximately 94%. After applying his rule extraction technique, the accuracy of the extracted rule set",
