When removing the base-classifier dependent features, IBk is still the best classifier with an additional error on <b>labor</b>  the smallest dataset. In this case MLR which is also a global learner is equally good. So we may tentatively conclude that for this meta-dataset, there seems to be no single feature which can predict the significant",
