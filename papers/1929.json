We used the diabetes, liver disorder, heart disease, breast cancer, vehicles, synthetic, pen-based recognition of handwritten digits (PBRHD) and <b>image segmentation</b> data sets in numerical experiments. Descriptions of these data sets can be found in [24]. First, we normalized all features. This was done by a nonsingular matrix so that mean values of all features were 1.",
