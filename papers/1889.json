    "window": "in (Keerthi and Lin 2003), due to the difficulty on solving linear SVMs, Algorithm 1 is only tested on small two-class problems. Here, we would like to evaluate this algorithm on large multi-class data sets. We consider problems <b>dna</b>  satimage, letter, and shuttle, which were originally from the statlog collection (Michie, Spiegelhalter, and Taylor 1994) and were used in (Hsu and Lin 2002a).
