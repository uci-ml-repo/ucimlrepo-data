    "window": "generalization performance of AdaBoost in the low noise regime. However, AdaBoost performs worse than other learning machines on noisy tasks [6, 7], such as the iris and the <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> benchmark data sets [5]. The present paper addresses the overfitting problem of AdaBoost in two ways. Primarily, it makes an algorithmic contribution to the problem of constructing regularized boosting algorithms.",
