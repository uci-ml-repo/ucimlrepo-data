    "window": "that have been used as benchmarks for rule extraction approaches are the Monk [43], <b>Mushroom</b> [32] and the DNA promoter [47] data sets. All three of these data sets inputs are symbolic/discrete by nature. Since we want to test more general problems that may include continuous valued variables, Iris and Breast-Cancer were preferred",
