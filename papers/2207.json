    "window": "GASEN's generalization error is significantly lower than that of the simple ensemble method, and e-GASEN attains still lower generalization errors than GASEN. On the <b>Servo</b> data set, GASEN is slightly inferior to simple ensemble. The e-GASEN method's performance, however, has no significant difference with that of the simple ensemble method. From the aforementioned statistics",
