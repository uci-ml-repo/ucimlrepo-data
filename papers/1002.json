The probability of the null hypothesis, # ####### , that both classifiers are equal suggests that only the differences for the <b>Balance</b> <b>scale</b> and the Pima Indian data sets are significant, with either method being better in one case. Since the generalization accuracies of both methods are almost identical, we conclude that if applied to 2 Vehicle data was donated to",
