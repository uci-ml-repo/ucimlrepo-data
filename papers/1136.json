Manifold of <b>face</b> Images In this subsection, we applied the LPP to images of faces. The <b>face image</b> data set used here is the same as that used in [5]. This dataset contains 1965 face images taken from sequential frames of a small video. The size of each image is 20 \u00d7 28, with 256 gray levels Figure 3: A",
