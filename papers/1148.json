    "window": "runs were selected. The model was then re-trained with the whole training data to produce the final clustering. The value of M was five in <b>Letter recognition</b>  and three for the other two data sets. I had to keep the number of candidate values, from which the best value was selected, quite small because of computational reasons. Preliminary runs were used to select a set of reasonable values",
