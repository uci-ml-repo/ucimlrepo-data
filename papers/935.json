    "window": "LPBoost has a well defined stopping criterion that is reached in a few iterations. It uses few weak learners. There are only 81 possible stumps on the <b>Breast</b> <b>Cancer</b> dataset (9 attributes having 9 possible values), so clearly AdaBoost may require the same tree to be generated multiple times. LPBoost generates a weak learner only once and can alter the weight on that",
