According to both the negative log-likelihood and the classification rate, the estimator New provides either the best or nearly the best results for six of the datasets. For the other two  <b>Spambase</b> and WDBC), its results are intermediate and comparable with other estimators. Along with this, it also reduces the model dimensionality, which the MLE can never do. 5.",
