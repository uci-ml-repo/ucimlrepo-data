When we look at the number of clusters or maximum number of partitions we see that a maximum of 2 clusters or partitions is clearly the best for this data set. The <b>Ionosphere</b> Data Set If we look at the results on the Ionosphere data set in Table 7 we see that using the gain ratio instead of the gain criterion with our refined gp algorithms greatly",
