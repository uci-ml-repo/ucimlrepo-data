A quantitative comparison of l DC against the number of nodes of the DTs shows that on 4 datasets out of the 13 (Pole, <b>Shuttle</b>  TicTacToe, Australian), the DCs are more than 6 times smaller, while they only incur a loss in accuracy for 2 of them, and limited to 1.8%. For this latter problem",
