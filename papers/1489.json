Examples of the combination weights it derives (for the probability-based model ~ M 0 ) appear in Table 5 for the <b>Splice</b> dataset. The weights indicate the relative importance of the level-0 generalizers for each prediction class. In this dataset, NB is the dominant generalizer for predicting class 2, NB and IB1 are both good",
