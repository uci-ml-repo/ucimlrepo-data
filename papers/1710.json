    "window": "our refined gp algorithm using the gain criterion performs a lot better than our simple gp algorithm and C4.5. If we look at the other two data set sets (German Credit and Pima Indians <b>Diabetes</b> , we see these are also the data sets on which our simple gp performs better than or close to C4.5. It is at the moment unclear why on these two data",
