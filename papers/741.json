    "window": "by Ripley [20], 29 instances were discarded, and the remaining 185 were re-grouped in four classes: window float glass (70), window nonfloat glass (76), <b>vehicle</b> window glass (17) and other (22). The data set was split randomly in a training set of size 89 and a test set of size 96. Our method (with normalized outputs) was compared to three neural network classifiers: learning vector quantization (LVQ)",
