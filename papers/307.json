    "window": "the effect of classification noise, we added random class noise to nine domains (audiology, hypo, king-rook-vs-king-pawn (krkp), satimage, sick, splice, segment, vehicle, and <b>waveform</b> . These data sets were chosen because at least one pair of the ensemble methods gave statistically significantly different performance on these domains. We did not perform noise experiments with letter-recognition",
