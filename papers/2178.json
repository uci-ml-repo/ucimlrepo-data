Using a so-called convex local subspace classifier, a smaller error rate of 2.1% was reported in [18]. 3.2.2 Public data sets 1: <b>satellite</b> image and handwritten digits Next we consider two public data sets obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [19]. The first example is a satellite image data set with 4435",
