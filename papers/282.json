    "window": "selection is done using the 1k validation sets, SVMs move slightly ahead of the neural nets.) Boosted stumps and plain decision trees are not competitive, though boosted stumps are best on the <b>Adult</b> data set. It is interesting to note that boosting weaker stump models is clearly inferior to boosting full decision trees on most of the test problems: boosting full decision trees yields better performance",
