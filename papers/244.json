    "window": "We also compared the algorithms by their ability to identify artificial corruptions. Three different test sets were used: a noise free version of the rock data described above, the UCI <b>Iris</b> data set, and the UCI Wine data set [3]. Noise was generated by choosing to corrupt each record with some probability p. For each record chosen, corruption and noise vectors were sampled from their",
