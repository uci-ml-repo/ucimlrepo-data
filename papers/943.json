    "window": "significant performance improvement across the tasks. In general, PFRL seems to outperform MARS on all the tasks. Superior performance by PFRL is particularly pronounced on the SegData and <b>Sonar</b> data sets. Moreover, the results show that PFRL can handle large problems with high dimensionality well by its superb performance on the 60 dimensional Sonar data set. Table 1: Average retrieval precision",
