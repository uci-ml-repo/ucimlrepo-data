To illustrate the convergence of batch and online learning, we experimented with the <b>Car</b> Evaluation dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [2]. The dataset has 1728 examples, of which we retained 346 (20%) as a test set and used 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, and all the remaining 1382 examples",
