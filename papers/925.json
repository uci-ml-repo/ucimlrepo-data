    "window": "with error rates around 80 percent. This empirically demonstrates PV's known sensitivity to learned models with highly correlated errors. On the other hand, PV performs well on the <b>glass</b> and wave data sets where the errors of the learned models are measured to be fairly uncorrelated. Here, SCANN performs similarly to PV, but S-BP and S-Bayes appear to be overfitting by making erroneous predictions",
