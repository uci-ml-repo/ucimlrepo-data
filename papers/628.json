The feature extraction process is illustrated in Figure 1: the C = 3 classes in the <b>iris</b> data set [1] are mapped onto single points by 1-SLLE. #-SLLE retains some of the class structure, but reduces within-class dispersion compared to LLE. Clearly, SLLE is suitable as a feature extraction step",
