The results show that our Weight-driven approach offers significant accuracy improvements (over both ADAMENN and the Random approach) for the three data sets with a larger number of dimensions  <b>spectf</b> test, lung, sonar). For liver and ionosphere the Random and Weight approaches give similar performances. This result provides evidence that bootstrapping",
