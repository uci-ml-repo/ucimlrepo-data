Figure 1 shows the Kappa-Error diagram for NN ensembles generated for the <b>Ionosphere</b> dataset by Bagging, randomly selecting 50 prototypes, and randomly selecting 6 6 features. Bagging results in a cloud of points centered roughly about (0.825,0.15). Using a smaller number of prototypes (50)",
