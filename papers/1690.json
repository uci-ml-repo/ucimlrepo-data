COMPARISON METHODS We have made experiments with crab data, <b>satellite</b> data, and MEG artefact data. These data sets will be brieAEy discussed in context with experimental results. Because we are now dealing with real-world data, the assumptions made on the ICA model (1) may not hold, or hold only approximately.",
