However in our experiments on the finite element mesh design and the King-Rook-King <b>chess</b> endgame datasets described below, PROGOL failed to produce a rule set within a reasonable time. In those experiments, we employed GOLEM developed by the same research group of PROGOL. We then compared the results",
