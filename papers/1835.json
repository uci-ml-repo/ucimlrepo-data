The three approaches have been used and compared in our experiments. 3.2 Experimental Evaluation We evaluate the effect of discretization on two datasets: the <b>Musk</b> dataset (available at the UCI repository [11]) and the Diterpene dataset, generously provided to us by Steffen Schulze-Kremer and Saso Dzeroski. Both datasets contain nondeterminate",
