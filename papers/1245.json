Using small sample sizes such as 100 or 200, we have tested the sampling approach on some Statlog datasets, including the <b>Shuttle</b> dataset which contains 43, 500 instances[6]. The results are promising. 6. Summary This paper proposes a new approach for getting better interpretations for clustering",
