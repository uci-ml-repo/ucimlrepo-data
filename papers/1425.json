    "window": "the efficacy of using multiple models. It is important to analyze these experimental data because the amount of error reduction obtained by using multiple models varies a great deal. On the <b>wine</b> data set, for example, the error obtained by uniformly weighted voting between eleven, stochastically-generated descriptions is only one seventh that of the error obtained by using a single description.
