Because disjuncts of a specific size for most concepts cover very few examples, statistically valid comparison were possible for only 4 of the 30 datasets (Coding, Move, <b>Adult</b>  and Market2); with the other datasets the number of examples covered by disjuncts of a given size is too small. The results for the Coding dataset are shown in Figure 8.",
