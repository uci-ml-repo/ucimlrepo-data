The machine-learning technique of decision graphs was successfully applied to the inference of a theory of <b>protein secondary</b> structure from a particular dataset by Dowe et al. [4] (see Section 4.4). The resulting decision graphs provided both an explanation and a prediction method for the problem. However, the Oliver-Wallace coding scheme [12, 11] only",
