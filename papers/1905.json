    "window": "none of the MOFSS-found solutions were dominated by the baseline solution (the set of all attributes). In general, MOFSS found more solutions than the GA, except in the <b>Vehicle</b> data set. In 2 data sets (Arrhytmia and Crx) the majority of solutions found by MOFSS dominate the baseline solution. However, in the other 4 data sets the majority of solutions found by MOFSS are neutral.",
