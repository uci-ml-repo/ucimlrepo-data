    "window": "cases a maximization of minimum margin at the expense of all other margins generally gave worse generalization performance than AdaBoost. As can be seen in Figure 3 (Credit Application and <b>Sonar</b> data sets), the generalization performance of the combined classifier produced by DOOM can be as good or better than that of the classifier produced by AdaBoost, despite having dramatically worse minimum",
