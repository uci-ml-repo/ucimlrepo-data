One difference between the two methods for weighting the confidence of predictions is that the Continuous method produces significant gains for two data sets, sonar and <b>vehicle</b>  for which the Discrete method does not perform well. In a second set of experiments we tested the idea of using RegionBoost where the estimated accuracy for a new point is",
