    "window": "we will briefly show how shaded similarity matrices are constructed and how one looks through an example. The data used in the example is part of the <b>Iris</b> data from the UCI repository[9]. The Iris data set contains 150 instances, evenly distributed in 3 classes. We fetch 5 instances from each class, and thus obtain 15 instances (Table 1). The similarity matrix was computed based on Euclidean distance",
