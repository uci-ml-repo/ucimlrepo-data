    "window": "As we can see from the results in figure 1, MIPSVM performs comparably well when it comes to classification accuracy for the Waveform and <b>Image Segment</b> datasets. For the Letter Recognition dataset it performs considerably worse than the other classifiers. This is likely to be caused by that MIPSVM doesn't have any balancing mechanisms one-against-the-rest",
