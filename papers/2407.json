Chess and Connect4 are gathered from game state information and are available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [5]. The Pumsb dataset is <b>census</b> data from PUMS (Public Use Microdata Sample). Pumsb-star is the same dataset as Pumsb except all items of 80% support or more have been removed, making it less dense and easier to mine.",
