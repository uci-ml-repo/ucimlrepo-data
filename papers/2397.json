A typical rule set generated by the proposed algorithm is shown in Table 3, which is obtained from one run on the data set <b>Heart</b> disease. IV. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we propose a novel rule learning algorithm that employs neural network ensemble as front-end process. The algorithm trains a neural network ensemble at",
