The influence of input renormalization (using Minkovsky distance functions) on the shapes of decision borders is illustrated in Fig. 30 for the classical <b>Iris</b> flowers dataset (only the last two input features, x 3 and x 4 are shown, for description of the data cf. [89]). Dramatic changes in the shapes of decision borders for different Minkovsky metrices are observed.",
