In one experiment reported by Breiman, the generalization error increases even though the margins of all of the instances are increased (for this dataset, called  <b>ionosphere</b> \" the number of instances is 351, much too small for our bounds to apply). While none of these experiments contradict the theory, they highlight the incompleteness of the theory",
