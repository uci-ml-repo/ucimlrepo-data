A linear support vector machine (SVM) is used to extract 6 features from a total of 31 features in a dataset of 253 <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> patients. Five features are nuclear features obtained during a non-invasive diagnostic procedure while one feature, tumor size, is obtained during surgery. The linear SVM",
