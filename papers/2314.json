From the results we can see that AdaBoost algorithm did su\u00aeer from overfitting on some of the data sets, such as \"German\",  <b>Breast</b> <b>cancer</b>  and \"Contraceptive\", while WeightBoost consistently achieved improvement on all of the eight data sets. In addition, our new algorithm demonstrates great",
