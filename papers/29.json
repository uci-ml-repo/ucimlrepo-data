    "window": "classifiers with Mfas are in Table 9. The set-up was as with the Bayesian Mpcas and again the Ml scores have been copied from Table 6. For the high-dimensional NIST, optical, <b>sonar</b>  and soybean data sets, a lower value of ` was chosen both for Mpcas and Mfas. This was done partly to save computation time and partly to avoid problems with the cheap and cheerful approximation already outlined in",
