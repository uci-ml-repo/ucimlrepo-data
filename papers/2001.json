The time complexities of the optimal algorithms for QDA and LDA based variable selection are O(N p d 2 ). Two data sets were used. The first, the <b>wine</b> data [11], is 13 dimensional with three classes and 59, 71 and 48 objects per class. The classes correspond to three different cultivars and the 13 variables measure",
