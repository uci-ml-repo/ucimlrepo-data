From the results presented in Table 3 we can conclude that appropriate values of c for the <b>liver</b> disorder data set are c 2 [0, 2]. Dierences in the number of clusters when c 2 [0, 2] arise because of small clusters which contain less than 5 % of all instances. Thus using results of numerical experiments on these",
