Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 {llora@illigal.ge.uiuc.edu, deg@uiuc.edu} Abstract This paper presents a theoretical model to predict the minimal achievable error, given a noise ratio #, in the <b>LED data</b> set problem. The motivation for developing this theoretical model is to understand and explain some of the results that different systems achieve when they solve the LED problem. Moreover, given a new",
