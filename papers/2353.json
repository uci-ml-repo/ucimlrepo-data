Table X and Fig. 4 also show that threshold-moving is always effective, and soft-ensemble only causes negative effect on the most seriously imbalanced data set <b>annealing</b>  SMOTE and hardensemble cause negative effect on soybean and annealing. It is noteworthy that the sampling methods cause negative effect on almost all data sets suffering from class",
