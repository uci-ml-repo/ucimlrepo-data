Experimental results To verify the effects of sample selection bias experimentally, we apply Naive Bayes, logistic regression, C4.5 and SVMLight (soft margin) (Joachims, 2000b) to the <b>Adult</b> dataset, available from the UCI Machine Learning repository (Blake & Merz, 1998). We assume that the original dataset is not biased and artificially simulate biasedness by generating a value for s for each",
