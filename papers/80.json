In the course of this latter experimentation, it was found that AIRS outperforms the best reported accuracy for the <b>E</b> <b>coli</b> data set found in the UCI repository [4]. The majority of AIS techniques use the metaphor of somatic hypermutation or a\u00b1nity proportional mutation. To date, AIRS does not employ this metaphor but instead",
