    "window": "true eigenvectors are approximated whilst tracking (ie up/downdating and downsizing) a kernel matrix. We consider a representative example of a kernel matrix, based upon the known <b>Abalone</b> benchmark dataset [14] with n = 3000 training instances having dimension p = 7. We consider the common choice of the radial basis kernel function (with h the kernel width parameter, fixed at 18.57): k(x i , x j ) =",
