In this paper we present CWS, a new algorithm with guaranteed O(e) complexity, and verify that it outperforms C4.5RULES and CN2 in time, accuracy and output size on two large datasets. For example, on NASA's <b>space</b> <b>shuttle</b> database, running time is reduced from over a month (for C4.5RULES) to a few hours, with a slight gain in accuracy. CWS is based on interleaving the induction",
