We visualize the intersection of this hyperplane with the 2D scatter plot matrices, i.e. a line in each matrix (as shown in Figure 7 with the <b>diabetes</b> data set, from the UCI repository). As we can see on figure 7, the resulting lines do not necessarily separate the two classes, the hyperplane does separate the data (the accuracy of the incremental SVM is",
