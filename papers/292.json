With this method they were able to improve performance on 7 of 10 domains tested (7 from the UCI repository and 3 proprietary <b>cloud</b> classification datasets), and they noted that ECOC accuracy gains tended to increase with increased diversity among the features selected for the two-class problems. NN-ECOC is similar to MFS as they both use NN",
