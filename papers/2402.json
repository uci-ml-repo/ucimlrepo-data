To study the performance we use a paired one-sided t-test on these runs, except for the <b>LED dataset</b>  which was run using hold-out with a training set of 2000 instances and a test set of 4000 instances. 5.2 Experimental analysis of weighting methods Table 2 shows the experimental results for each",
