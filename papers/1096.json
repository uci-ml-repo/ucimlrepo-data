In Section 5 we present the performance of order statistic combiners on a real world <b>sonar</b> problem [15], and several data sets from the Proben1/UCI benchmarks [4, 25]. Section 6 discusses the implications of using linear combinations of order statistics as a strategy for pooling the outputs of individual classifiers. 2",
