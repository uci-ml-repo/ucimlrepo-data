Thus, observing Table 6, the one-point crossover is better suited for Horsecolic and <b>Soybean</b> large datasets than the uniform crossover; otherwise, we see the opposite behaviour in Ionosphere and Anneal. By the use of FSS-EBNA, we also avoid this tunning among different crossover operators for each",
