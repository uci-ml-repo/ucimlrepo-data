DeEPs versus k-NN. ffl Both DeEPs and k-NN perform equally accurately on soybean-small (100%) and on <b>iris</b> (96%). ffl DeEPs wins on 26 data sets; k-NN wins on 11. It can be seen that the accuracy of DeEPs is generally better than that of k-NN. ffl The speed of DeEPs is about 1.5 times slower than that of k-NN. The main reason is that DeEPs",
