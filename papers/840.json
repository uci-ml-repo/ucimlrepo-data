We then selected three difficult problems: the EXP6 problem developed by Kong (1995), the <b>Letter Recognition</b> data set (Frey & Slate, 1991), and the Pima Indians Diabetes Task (Merz & Murphy, 1996). Of course, C4.5 and NN do not have the same performance on these data sets. In EXP6 and Letter Recognition, NN",
